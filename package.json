  "description": "This two-part video series provides an in-depth look at optical interferometry. Part 1 covers the principles behind interferometry and the layout of a ZYGO GPI LC interferometer from the 1990s. Part 2 demonstrates how to use the interferometer to accurately measure the surface shapes and optical properties of mirrors, lenses, and microscope objectives.",
