# Optical Interferometry Part 1 - Introduction & ZYGO GPI layout

hey everyone today I want to talk about

Optical interferometry a method that is

frequently used to measure the

properties of optical components and

systems

what initially made me want to do a

video about this subject is this zygo

interferometer that I bought a while ago

secondhand

a new instrument of this type is

financially far out of my reach and I

must admit that this one wasn't a

bargain either but the thing is I wanted

to own a high quality interferometer for

a long time if only to get away from the

do-it-yourself setups that I've used so

far and since these instruments are not

abundantly available secondhand I just

had to take this rare opportunity to buy

one

in case you have no idea what this

instrument is with it you can very

accurately measure the shape of flat and

spherical Optical interfaces like the

ones you find on lenses and mirrors and

with accurately I mean in the nanometer

range

but not only that you can also measure

the performance of complete Optical

systems so a good interferometer is an

indispensable tool for anyone involved

in Optical fabrication because in the

end the quality of your Optics is mainly

limited by the quality of your testing

methods

this particular instrument was produced

by zygo in August of 1996 it was sold to

Philips Electronics in Eindhoven where

it was used to check the surface shape

of lenses of special Optical disk drives

from what I understood some of these

lenses were produced from small polished

glass balls and these were cut in pieces

and then transformed into very short

focal distance lenses now at some point

the activity was transferred to a

Phillips spin-off called anterion and

the interferometer was sold to an

employee who basically stored it for a

couple of years he then sold it to me

together with a black and white Monitor

and the transmission sphere that was

used to test the lenses

in this video I'll first discuss the

principle behind interferometry and then

we'll take a look at the layout of the

instrument and how it works exactly and

in an upcoming video I'll show you how I

pimped the instrument a bit with a

modern CCD camera

as I said earlier in Optics manufacturer

interferometry is a frequently used

method to characterize both Optical

surfaces as well as complete systems and

the method is based on analyzing

interference patterns and extract

so-called wavefront information from

them and I will discuss the meaning of

the word wavefront in a second

interferometry is an extremely sensitive

and accurate method that can be used to

establish the general shape of an

interface but also things like waviness

or even surface roughness it does also

have some limitations the measurement

ranges generally fairly limited to

several microns also it's unsuitable for

interfaces that contain sharp step-like

height features because these cannot be

unambiguously identified and so in

general interferometry is most accurate

when the surfaces we want to test are

fairly smooth

now I just mentioned the word wavefront

which I think is not a trivial concept I

guess we've all experienced wavefronts

at some points in our lives but I'm not

referring to those in Optics away from

this actually a continuous set of points

that have identical phase so what does

that mean well from a classical

Viewpoint light is an electromagnetic

wave that harmonically oscillates and

propagates in space and at any given

point in this process the electric and

magnetic field components can be

described by the Maxwell equations so

here I've tried to schematically draw

the electromagnetic field in a somewhat

larger volume and if you examine the

phase of these waves you can identify

planes where the face of the

electromagnetic field is identical and

the continuous set of points that have

the same phase value is called away

front

one property of a wavefront is that its

shape is always transverse or

perpendicular to the local direction of

wave propagation here this is

Illustrated for a few differently shaped

wavefronts where the arrows indicate the

direction of wave propagation now in

general phase relationships for

different points in space are only well

defined when the waves have one specific

wavelength and if we want to do

interferometry it's vital that the light

we use is of one particular wavelength

which is also called monochromatic light

and in the rest of this video I'll

assume that the light used is more or

less monochromatic

a frequently used way to generate

monochromatic radiation is by means of a

laser and this is because the process of

stimulated emission which takes place in

the laser cavity favors the generation

of light in a very narrow wavelength

range also the wavefront exiting the

laser cavity is virtually flat over the

aperture and because the light has an

extremely well defined wavelength in

other words it has a very narrow

spectral bandwidth phase relationships

in the field exiting the laser can be

preserved over long distances

another way to say this is that lasers

have a long coherence length which is

generally between half a meter up to

several kilometers for certain special

types of lasers

in practice this means that if we take

two points A and B in the light path and

we look at the variations in the phase

difference between the two points we

will find that these will be relatively

small and the distance over which

variations in Phase remain acceptable is

called the coherence length as you can

see from this equation the coherence

length LC is inversely proportional to

the spectral bandwidth Delta Nu of the

light source and so light sources with a

very narrow emission line will generally

have a long coherence length

another source of monochromatic light

frequently used in interferometry is the

low pressure sodium lamp which mainly

generates light in a narrow emission

band at 589 nanometers however the

spectral bandwidth of the sodium

emission line is much broader than that

of lasers and the phase relationships

generally only hold over distances

smaller than a millimeter

now measuring the shape of a waveform

directly in the visible part of the

electromagnetic spectrum is not easy and

that is because of the high frequencies

involved for electromagnetic radiation

of longer wavelengths like for example

radio waves we can measure the phase of

the alternating Fields directly and that

is because the oscillations have

relatively low frequency say generally

somewhere in the mega or gigahertz range

and so we can point a bunch of antennas

to the sky measure the electromagnetic

signals that are received in each of

them and then establish the shape of the

wavefront for a particular frequency by

looking for phase correlations and based

on this information we can identify the

exact direction from which the radiation

is emitted

but the visible light has a frequency

more than a thousand times higher than

even the highest frequency radio waves

and for frequencies this high it's

technically infeasible to measure phase

directly for an oscillating

electromagnetic field

however what we can easily measure with

Optical detectors like CCD or CMOS

sensors is spatial intensity variations

and that is where interferometry comes

in instead of trying to measure the

phase in light directly this method

works by studying the interference

patterns resulting from the addition of

a second wavefront that has a known

shape

let me start by showing you a very

simple example of how this works in

light

for this experiment we need a

monochromatic light source and a flat

surface as a light source we'll use a

sodium lamp and for the surface we'll

use a flat Optical test glass

now a typical air gloss interface

reflects about four percent of the

incident light and with a uniform light

source we observe a uniform reflection

let's now place two differently shaped

surfaces on top of this reference

surface for evaluation and what we now

observe is that these objects show two

different interference patterns the part

of the left shows straight lines with

equal spacing and I wanted to write this

place these curved lines or circular

fringes depending on the exact surface

orientation now it's these intensity

variations that actually contain

detailed information about the

difference in shape between the

reference surface and the two surfaces

under tests and we just need to know how

to interpret what we see exactly

so what do we see well let me explain

with an animation I admit the following

is a simplification and it's not

correctly visualizing the physics but

it's actually quite illustrative here is

away from that has just reflected off a

flat reference surface so this wavefront

is basically also flat and so the image

shows a 2d cross-section of the flat

Optical wavefront

now we place a sensor in the path of the

light we can measure the intensity and

what we observe is that it's basically

the same everywhere and this tells us

exactly nothing about the shape of the

wavefront

now let's add a second wavefront that

has reflected of a second surface that

is slightly tilted in this example the

wavefront is also flat and what we

observe is that the intensity now

becomes non-uniform and this is caused

by constructive and destructive

interference between the two reflected

wavefronts at the second interface here

the electromagnetic field is the linear

sum of the contributions of the fields

of the two wavefronts and so in some

points where these contributions are

always in Phase they add up on the other

hand in places where the two are exactly

out of phase the field contributions

cancel each other out and if they are of

equal amplitude effectively the

resulting field becomes zero

in the case of two flat wavefronts we

will observe linear and equally spaced

fringes and the density of the

interference pattern itself is dependent

on the wedge or angle between the two

surfaces and the position of the fringes

is dependent on the distance between the

two surfaces now you might think that

linear and equally spaced fringes are

indicative for the presence of two flat

surfaces and that's partly correct but

two curved wavefronts with exactly the

same radius of curvature will actually

also display linear and equally spaced

fringes when displays are tilted

however when two waveforms have

different radii this results in curve

fringes and this is for example the case

when we have a flat and a spherical

wavefront interfering or when we have

two spherical waveforms that have a

different radius of curvature so I guess

it's important to realize that the

observed interference pattern only gives

us information about differences in

wavefront shape

the example just shown with the Sodium

lamp we only observe interference

between the interfaces when they're

placed very close together and that is

because of the limited coherence length

of the light so whether we can see a

clear interference pattern is dependent

on whether stable phase relationships

exists between the reflections coming

off the two surfaces at the point where

they start interfering and this means

that with a coherence length smaller

than a millimeter the surfaces need to

be quite close to each other in order to

observe interference fringes

now I just stated that in constructive

interference the electromagnetic fields

add up and in destructive interference

the two contributions cancel each other

out so what does this mean for intensity

well light intensity is equivalent to

the power per unit of surface and so

it's actually not the same thing as the

magnitude of the electronic field in

fact intensity scales with the square of

this field and so if we have two

reflections of equal magnitude say both

are four percent this means that for the

location of constructive interference

the intensity could be four times as

high and that is actually what is

generally observed in interference

patterns that the intensity in the

bright areas is much brighter than the

sum of the two individual intensities

but of course if we look on average the

intensity over the whole area will still

be equal to the sum of the two

individual intensities

anyway enough background let's return to

the zygote interferometer itself and

take a peek under the hood to see what's

going on inside

in order to do that we need to remove

two different Lids the outer one is made

of plastic and it's basically just

cosmetic and the second one is made out

of aluminum sheet metal and it is

intended as RF shielding for the

electronics inside

the first thing you notice is that it

isn't awfully full inside there is a

helium neon laser with its high voltage

power supply then there are a few

Optical components like a steering

mirror for a laser beam a variable

filter that can be moved mechanically

using a rod and this Rod also operates a

switch that activates either of two PCB

cameras that can also be found in this

top part of the interferometer

and the cameras by the way have CCD

chips of about four by six millimeter in

size and are fairly low resolution

now both cameras have lenses mounted in

front of them and one of the cameras is

above a tiny beam splitter and the other

one is above a diffuser with a Crosshair

printed on it

in the bottom compartment behind the lid

here we find the mains 12 volt DC power

supply a large beam splitter a mirror

under 45 degrees and a four inch

collimation lens and apart from a few

brackets and mounts that hold the Optics

together that is basically it

so you might wonder why was this thing

the price of a luxury car back in 1996

well apart from I suspect a healthy

profit margin there are several reasons

of course it's not really a mass

manufactured item but another reason is

that every component inside appears to

be of very high quality take for example

the helium neon laser according to the

label the tube has been specifically

selected for this type of instrument why

well if we look at the specification of

the coherence length of the

interferometer we see that it's larger

than 100 meters this means that the

wavelength variations in the laser light

need to be extremely low so that the

phase relationships hold over distances

of more than 100 meters now I calculated

what this means in terms of frequency

stability and found that variations in

the frequency of the light cannot be

more than 2 times 10 to the minus seven

percent and so this means that not just

any random laser will do

so let me take you through the

functionality of all the optical

components step by step using schematics

here is the helium mule laser which

outputs a highly coherent beam of light

and the direction of the beam can be

optimized with this small steering

mirror after which the beam goes through

a variable attenuation filter now this

filter allows for adjustment of the

general brightness of the laser beam and

after having passed the attenuation

filter the beam is going into a gradient

index lens which is connected to a very

small beam splitter

now a gradient index lens is a small

glass rod that contains a gradient in

refractive index that runs from the

center to the edge of the rod and since

the refractive index has the highest

value in the center the optical

wavefront in the laser beam is gradually

delayed more towards the center of the

rod and the waveform therefore becomes

curved which effectively results in

focusing of the light into a tight focal

point and after passing this focal point

the beam expands again into a nicely

spherical wavefront

a small beam splitter sends the

spherical waveform into the partially

reflective surface of a second much

larger beam splitter and this surface

reflects the light towards a collimation

lens where the light exits the

instrument

the function of the collimation lens is

to convert the spherical wavefront into

a flat wavefront of four inches in

diameter and this flat waveform can

serve as the basis for all kinds of

interferometric tests for example we can

place two partially reflective flat

interfaces into this output beam one

being the reference interface and one

being the interface that we'd like to

test for flatness and due to the large

coherence length of the light more than

100 meters these interfaces don't have

to be necessarily very close together

the light reflecting of these surfaces

is directed back into the interferometer

approximately along the same path as it

came from goes through a small beam

splitter again and then is collimated

and projected on the CCD chip and this

allows us to observe the interference

pattern between the two Reflections and

evaluate this visually on the monitor

now to steer the light off both the

reference and test surface exactly back

through the tiny beam splitter here is

pretty hard and you don't see anything

with camera one until things are almost

perfectly aligned so to make life a lot

easier the people at zygo edit this

alignment functionality to the system

part of the light from the reflections

can pass this larger beam splitter and

this part continues straight on it's

reflected at 90 degrees angle and then

reaches the glass diffuser plate that

contains a Crosshair pattern

because this diffuser plate is exactly

at the focal distance of the collimation

lens the reflections create tiny spots

here and their positions can be observed

by camera 2 that is only intended for

alignment purposes now this alignment

unit has a much larger field of view and

what we can do now is simply align the

position of the surface reflection such

that they are at the center of the

Crosshair and when that's the case the

system is also automatically aligned on

camera one we can immediately observe an

interferogram

now the interferometers that I made

myself did not have this kind of feature

and I must admit that this really makes

aligning Optics a piece of cake

here you see the location of the

collimation lens viewed from the outside

of the instrument in front of it is an

adjustment mechanism that is intended

for mounting various reference surfaces

to the interferometer directly like for

example the f.7 D5 transmission sphere

that came with interferometer

the adjustment mechanism has two degrees

of freedom which are tip and tilt and

this allows the angle of the

transmission reference to be oriented

with respect to the surface under test

so when testing Optical components you

generally test the surface shape before

the interfaces get coated and so in the

case of glosses means that they reflect

around four percent of the incident

light

so the transmission reference also needs

to reflect around four percent back into

the interferometer to get high contrast

fringes

not to test spherical surfaces you need

a spherical reference surface that

somehow reflects four percent of the

light exiting the infrometer right back

into the instrument

here I've drawn a schematic of the

inside of a transmission sphere assembly

to show you how that is achieved

the reference surface is the last

interface of the assembly here indicated

in yellow and all the other surfaces are

anti-reflection coated for the laser

wavelength

but even more importantly they're also

designed in such a way that the Light

reaches the reference interface exactly

perpendicular and this means that it's

the only interface in the transmission

sphere that sends a reflection back

where it came from and then enters the

interferometer as a collimated beam and

of course

96 of the light continues onto the

surface under test which also reflects

around four percent and so we observe

the interference occurring between these

two interfaces

with a spherical transmission reference

we can test convex as well as concave

optics for convex Optics only radii is

smaller than the radius of the

transmission sphere itself can be tested

and for concave Optics the only

limitation for the radius to be tested

is that it should be less than half of

the maximum coherence length of the

light source that we use which is in

this case 50 meters

now I want to save most of the

experiments that I had in mind for

another video but let's just do one

simple experiment for this test we'll

just use the flat wavefront exiting the

instrument and what we'll try to measure

is the difference in shape between the

two surfaces of a zero to your test

Clause this test class has one side

which I know is very flat around 120th

of a wavelength and this is going to be

our reference interface but the other

side is somewhat less flat and what

we'll try to find out is how much that

is

the two interfaces are spaced 20

millimeters apart and both reflect

around four percent of the incident

light so we can just place the disc in

the beam exiting the interferometer

align the position of the two

Reflections simultaneously and then look

at the interference pattern and this is

what it looks like as you can see we get

a nice and clear interference pattern

which by the way is extremely stable

with no effects of vibrations from the

environment and that is because the two

surfaces are basically mechanically

connected to each other by a solid piece

of zero Doer

now the small circular spots are just

dust particles in the optical path and

these are not important for our

evaluation

all the information about the different

in shape and orientation between the two

surfaces is contained in the four more

or less vertical fringes and because we

know that one side is almost perfectly

flat any curvature in The Fringe pattern

is a result of non-flatness of the

second interface

so let's try to evaluate this pattern

visually the most obvious feature is of

course the presence of the four vertical

fringes that indicate that there is a

wedge between the two interfaces in the

horizontal Direction and we can evaluate

how large this wedge is based on the

number of fringes it's a little over

four lobda wavefront meaning that there

is a wedge half of that between the two

surfaces so just two wavelengths y half

well that is because in reflection any

deviations in surface shape lead to

twice the deviation in the wave front

shape and so deviations in the surface

shape are only half of that observed in

the wavefront

now since the wavelength of the laser is

633 nanometers and the wedge is two

lobbed up between the two surfaces this

would mean a gradient in distance of

approximately 1.3 microns but there is a

little catch in this case because we are

comparing two surfaces with zero during

between them we should actually use the

wavelength in this material which means

that we should divide the wavelength in

air or vacuum by the refractive index of

zero deer which is 1.54

so this means that the wedge is actually

only 840 nanometers but which side is

thicker it's actually quite hard to tell

as for which we would see the same type

of interference pattern in either case

so at this point we just don't know

okay let's for a moment focus on the

curvature of the fringes now which

indicates a difference in the radius

between the two surfaces and if we look

at how much the curvature in the fringes

deviates from straight lines we see that

it's largest here in the center it's

about 0.4 times The Fringe spacing which

translates to 0.4 wavelengths of height

difference between the edge and the

center of the disc

for the surface error which again is

half of that we find 0.2 wavelengths now

since we also need to use the wavelength

inside zero do here this means that the

surface curvature is 0.2 times the

wavelength divided by the refractive

index which results in a value of 82

nanometers

but in which direction is the curve is

the surface under test 82 nanometers

concave or convex as for the direction

of the wedge there is no easy way to

tell so now we end up with these four

configurations of which only one can be

correct

with a little logic though you could at

this point already discard two of these

as infeasible but of course you want to

know exactly which configuration of the

four is correct right

so if that's indeed the case figure it

out yourself you just need two more

pieces of information here is a first

hint if I press my finger against the

back side of the disk so the service and

the test we can observe that the

interferogram changes due to the

temperature increase of the material by

the heat of my finger locally it's only

a few degrees Celsius higher but the

effect is very noticeable because we are

measuring in the nanometer range

now the second piece of information you

need is about the expansion coefficient

of the material as you can see from the

specifications of zero zero it can be

either positive or negative

but this piece of 02 has a positive

coefficient of thermal expansion which

means it expands with temperature

increase and with these two additional

pieces of information it's possible to

tell which of these four options is

correct now the first person to make a

comment with the correct answer and of

course why owns the pinned comment

okay so the letter was a very brief

explanation of how you can evaluate

interferograms visually and the above

example was actually relatively easy

imagine your interferogram looks

something like this or this in these

cases it would be quite a bit more

challenging to make accurate statements

about the exact surface shape

and this is why in the next video about

the subject I have replaced the current

analog camera with a high resolution IP

camera and this allows for a very

detailed evaluation of the

interferograms using software

with the help of this software we can

measure wedges angles surface curvature

and even the effect of warm fingers very

accurately also we'll take a look at how

to measure the shape of various Optical

surfaces and the quality of lens

assemblies so hopefully I'll see you in

the next video again

thank you

# Optical Interferometry Part 2 - Measuring Optics with a Zygo GPI LC


hey everyone

today I want to demonstrate how the zygo

interferometer that I bought a few

months ago can be used to test Optics in

the previous video I explained how

interferometry Works what a wavefront is

and discuss the layout of the instrument

if you're unfamiliar with interferometry

and you haven't seen the previous video

it might be a good idea to watch that

one first

this video became quite long so here's

an overview of the contents which allows

you to skip ahead if you don't want to

watch everything first I'll show how I

replace the original low resolution

camera of the zygote with a modern IP

camera to record high resolution

interferograms and then we'll take a

quick look at how we can use the camera

in combination with the software called

DFT Fringe to create detailed wavefront

maps

the interferometer came with a reference

transmission sphere but unfortunately

the waveform documentation of this item

was missing so to do meaningful

measurements with it we first need to

establish its accuracy by performing a

calibration and with that done we can

test some actual Optics we'll examine

the surface properties of a high quality

concave wafer scanner mirror from the

1970s then we'll take a look at the

wavefront quality of a vintage Canon F

1.2 lens from the early 1980s will do

the same for a modern full-frame Canon

EF zoom lens and in the last part of the

video I'll show you measurements on the

optical properties of a couple of

microscope objectives all in all there's

quite a lot to cover so let's Dive Right

In

as shown in the previous video the

interferometer is a somewhat basic

version that displayed low resolution

black and white images on a monitor for

visual evaluation the instrument

contained two cameras one for the

alignment of the Optics under test and

one for displaying the interferogram

both cameras had a rather limited

resolution of 320 times 240 pixels now

since this is not 1996 anymore we can

now do quite a bit better than that

for the new camera to record the

interferograms I wanted to use a housed

camera with some kind of Mount to be

able to attach various types of lenses

and if you look at the layout of the

instrument there's actually plenty of

space to place such a camera in the

instrument right here we just need to

redirect the light in the horizontal

Direction so what I did was remove the

old camera and the lens and then made a

bracket that can hold a first surface

mirror under 45 degrees and this mirror

redirects the vertical beam to a

horizontal one which can then be

captured by the camera I tried different

kinds of lenses and eventually settled

on this compact 25 millimeter C mount

lens that works for most situations it's

able to capture the full field of the

interferometer while at the same time

covering a fairly large area of the

camera chip but of course for specific

measurements it's possible to use other

lenses like lenses with a longer focal

length or a variable zoom lens and this

can be very useful if you want to take a

look at small details in interferograms

by the way I left the original alignment

camera where it was because it still

works fine and you actually don't need a

lot of resolution to do the alignment

so the original monitor is still used in

the setup but only during alignment

procedures

for powering the IP camera I connected

it to a 12 volt power supply already

present in the instrument and after that

there was just one more thing to do and

that was bringing the camera's UTP

connection to the housing of the

instrument and for this purpose I used a

two-sided UTP female connector one side

connects to the camera the other side

connects to a PC and with that the

conversion is complete

now I used an IDs ethernet camera for

the conversion but in fact any camera

will do as long as it can be accessed

from a computer and the images can be

stored to disk so to capture the data

what I do is I align the optic to be

measured such that a clear interferogram

is visible with well-defined fringes it

helps if the camera software has a

feature to monitor the maximum Fringe

intensity so that we can adjust it to

within the linear dynamic range of the

camera then I collect the number of

interferograms with somewhat different

Fringe angles and spacings and these can

then serve as the basis for a wavefront

analysis

for the actual wavefront calculations

we'll use a free software called DFT

Fringe it's programmed by Dale Eason who

took it upon himself to make advanced

interferometry accessible to the masses

it's designed with amateur telescoping

in mind but as will become clear its

application range is quite a bit broader

than that I won't delve into all the

functionality of the software instead

I'll just very quickly walk you through

the process of evaluating interferograms

and averaging wavefronts

so here is the start screen of DFT

Fringe and before you can evaluate the

inferiograms correctly a program

requires the input of a few settings

like what wavelength is used and what

The Fringe spacing in the interferogram

actually represents now in some

configurations each Fringe represents

one wavelength of phase shift but in

others like in Auto collimation this

value actually needs to be set to 0.5

and when all the parameters are set

we're basically ready to go

the software gets us to our results in a

few steps you start by importing a

recorded interferogram and Define the

areas you wish to include or exclude in

the wavefront evaluation

if that's done the software performs a

2d Fourier transform on the selected

area and allows us to do a bit of low

frequency spatial filtering this

filtering can for example remove low

spatial frequencies that are the result

of the global intensity variations due

to an even illumination over the full

surface and after setting the low

frequency spatial filtering the image is

resampled to a specific size and from

this the software calculates the

waveform data

when the software calculates the

wavefront it also fits the data to a

specific set of known aberrations this

feature allows for removing specific

aberrations from your analysis for

example tilt is generally not an

aberration of interest because it

describes the orientation between the

reference and the wavefront under test

and so it has nothing to do with the

shape of either surface now DFD Fringe

allows you to either include or exclude

it from your analysis

you can customize the presentation of

the results and the scale you can also

for example convert wavefront errors to

surface shape errors and choose to

represent them in nanometers instead of

waves all in all this is a very useful

tool for interferometric Fringe analysis

and on top of that it can be downloaded

for free

in all the upcoming experiments I will

use this F 0.75 transmission sphere as a

reference and as I mentioned in the

introduction we don't know anything

about its accuracy of shape so before we

can measure any meaningful results with

it we need to measure the accuracy of

the reference sphere first but how do we

do that we could of course calibrate the

surface of the transmission sphere by

comparing its shape to a more precise

reference surface but instead I want to

show you another method known as the

random Ball Method

the method requires the use of a small

smooth ball with a reflective surface

the surface of the ball doesn't need to

be perfectly spherical but I guess it

helps if it's quite close to spherical

now the only thing we need to do for the

experiment is to measure the surface

shape of the ball at many random

positions with the reference sphere and

then average these measurements now the

reason that this works is that if you

collect a lot of samples from a bowl

surface even if it's far from perfect

all the errors in the individual parts

of the surface will eventually average

out and the average will iterate to a

surface equivalent of a perfect sphere

and when you get to that point the only

error that remains is the surface error

in the reference sphere because it's

systematically present in all the

individual measurements

you can buy these special high accuracy

silicon carbide balls for this purpose

and these are pretty expensive however

there's a much cheaper way I just used a

Precision aluminum oxide bearing ball

that typically costs less than let's say

25 Euros online

the largest balls generally have a

diameter of around 10 millimeters and

have a variation in the diameter of

about one micron so they're not

incredibly precise but as you will see

precise enough for this experiment

to hold the ball I made a stand from

three quarter inch bearing balls glued

on top of an aluminum rod using epoxy

and now we have a calibration setup

ready for less than 30 Euros

calibration procedure itself involves

placing this ball at the center of the

radius of curvature of the transmission

sphere in some random orientation we

record an interferogram then choose a

different random area on the ball record

another one and so on

and here is what evaluating the results

looks like in Practice What You observe

is that in the individual measurements

the surface area is generally larger

than a quarter of lobda and it's

actually all over the place and this is

due to the errors present in the shape

of the ball but look what happens when

we start averaging these measurements

after 10 measurements the error has

basically dropped down to a tenth of a

lobda peaked Valley and by adding more

and more measurements to the average we

can gradually bring this down even

further until after evaluating about 50

interferograms we do not see Improvement

anymore in the result and at that point

we know that the error that remains is

basically the error in the transmission

sphere reference

if we look at the accuracy of shape in

the spherical reference it's about 1

20th of a wavelength peaked Valley and

we will consider this to be the

wavefront accuracy over the full area of

the transmission sphere

now in all the upcoming tests we will

only use a small fraction of this

reference surface which will make the

accuracy of the tests quite a bit higher

than 1 20th of a lot

DFD Fringe presents the value of the

strail ratio quite prominently and I

actually discussed sterile ratio in

another video I must admit still ratio

is not the most common parameter used in

the specification of the optical quality

of for example lenses but for specifying

wavefront performance close to the

diffraction limit I think it's a very

useful parameter what it describes is

basically just the ratio between where

wave energy actually ends up in the

image compared to where it should have

ended up if the optic were perfect

so here's a graph of an intensity

profile of an imperfect optic and of a

perfect optic now to calculate this

Trail we take the area that is under

both curves and name it B and then

divide this by the area under the

perfect curve so area a and this

represents the fraction of the light

energy that goes where it should have

gone in an image

since Trail ratio is a fraction its

value is between 0 and 1 and the value

of 1 only applies to an object that

performs at the theoretical limit now

roughly speaking an optic with a trail

ratio value above 0.83 is considered to

be diffraction Limited what this doesn't

mean is that the optic is performing

perfectly in this region it just means

that the dominant factor for reduced

sharpness is because of diffraction for

example because of a limited aperture

and to a lesser degrees due to

imperfections and things like a surface

shape so in a sense the value of 0.83 is

similar to stating that a quarter

overlapped up Peak to Value wavefront

error is diffraction limited because

both these values are kind of arbitrary

definitions of what is meant by

diffraction Limited

so our reference surface turns out to be

very accurate as we can conclude from

both this Trail value as well as from

the peak to Valley wavefront error but

of course that is kind of essential if

you want to use it to measure Optical

quality of other objects in the high end

of the range

the first thing we're going to measure

is the surface shape of this spherical

zero deer mirror it's about 250

millimeters in diameter and it has a

radius of curvature of 350 millimeters I

bought the mirror about 10 years ago on

eBay for around 100 euros the reflective

coating was in pretty bad shape so I

removed it but the remaining surface

reflectivity is four percent which is

ideal in this test setup the mirror

itself is from a 1970s broken Elmer

wafer scanner system and this was the

first commercial photolithographic

system that used non-contact exposure of

silicon Wafers so given its original

application you'd expect this mirror to

be quite accurate

the way we measure this mirror is with

the focus of the reference element in

the center of the radius of curvature of

the mirror so the tightly focused Light

Beam from the interferometer expands and

then reflects off the mirror surface and

then returns along approximately the

same path and is recombined with the

spherical reference wavefront that

reflects off the reference element and

any deviations from spherical in the

mirror surface will cause phase shifts

between the light reflecting of the

mirror surface and the spherical

reference and this can then be observed

as interference

here are a few typical interferograms

that were measured with this mirror

under a slight tilt and even though the

mirror is strongly curved you can

observe that in the measurements it only

covers about half the diameter of the

total measurement area available this

makes our accuracy of measurement much

higher than a 20th of a wavelength

so from the interferograms just

collected the waveform differences

between the mirror surface and that of

the reference element is calculated in

DFD Fringe and you can see that the peak

to Value accuracy of this mirror itself

is around one tenth of a wavelength now

in terms of surface shape accuracy this

means that the mirror never deviates

more than around 30 nanometers of that

of a perfect sphere

anyway being able to measure with this

level of precision is actually pretty

cool and it gave me confidence that the

instrument performs as expected

by the way if you've ever tried to make

a telescope Mirror by hand yourself you

might observe something familiar in the

wavefront plot The Mirror Has a slightly

turned down Edge although this one's

very small around 15 nanometers or so

next on the list of items to test is

this Canon FD 55 millimeter F 1.2 lens

this is a rather famous vintage lens in

the sense that it was actually the first

consumer lens containing an aspherical

element

with its F 1.2 aperture it's very light

sensitive and therefore well suited for

indoor photography without using a flash

the earliest versions of this lens

introduced in 1971 contained radioactive

thorium oxide but this one which was

bought by my father in March of 1980

does not contain thorium therefore it

also does not display the characteristic

radiation Browning observed in

radioactive lenses and on top of that it

has lift in the Box most of it's live so

it's a nearly pristine condition

for testing the waveform deformation in

this lens we utilize a configuration

called Auto collimation which is

schematically depicted here because the

light passes through the lens twice in

this test many aberrations are measured

to be twice as large as they would be

with a single pass so when this

configuration is used it requires us to

interpret The Fringe spacing as

equivalent to only 0.5 wavelength

instead of one wavelength

before I show you the results of the

measurement I should mention that doing

away front measurement on a lens is not

in any way representative for overall

lens performance basically we're testing

with only one particular wavelength of

light on the optical axis with the focus

setting to Infinity so factors like

chromatic aberrations of axis

performance in the image field and at

proximity are not included in this test

I've actually made a video on how to

quantitatively measure all these aspects

using another method and obtain a more

holistic performance but even with all

the limitations I think it's worthwhile

to take a look at the wavefront error

that this lens introduces

so here is the wavefront error of the

lens at its full aperture and as you can

see it's actually pretty large the total

peaked Valley wavefront error is more

than three lobda and the most apparent

errors are spherical aberration and some

astigmatism

the streel ratio is actually quite

disappointing as well

now as a consequence this lens can never

provide High sharpness images at the

maximum aperture

now it's interesting to see what happens

if we limit the aperture of this lens to

let's say F4 and by doing that we'll

lose a lot of light about 90 percent but

this also limits the wavefront error to

the one present in this central part

here so if we do the same wavefront

analysis at F4 suddenly the lens

performs the fraction limited because

reducing aperture to F4 eliminates

almost all of the spherical error and

astigmatism which is present in the

wavefront at full aperture

here's a comparison of the text on a

permanent marker shot with f 1.2 and f4

on an aps-c sensor it's clear that the

three laptop wavefront arrow is

influencing the sharpness and contrast

pretty badly so I guess the only way to

use this lens effectively is to always

set it to a smaller aperture whenever

there's sufficient light available

otherwise you'll end up with very soft

images

the Canon EF 24 to 105 millimeters full

frame zoom lens is next on our list I

just want to take a very brief look at

it mainly because I sometimes use it for

my YouTube videos with its maximum

aperture of f4 over the whole Zoom range

it's not particularly Photon hungry but

it always produces excellent image

sharpness which made me curious about

how small the wavefront errors in a high

quality lens actually are

it was measured in the same way as the F

1.2 lens so in outer collimation and

here are the wavefront errors at the

focal length settings of 24 millimeters

50 millimeters and 105 millimeters the

largest waveform errors are found at 105

millimeters focal distance where this

Trail ratio has dropped to 0.6 which by

the way is still a very decent value for

a lens

in the center of the range its

performance is basically diffraction

limited so concluding this lens performs

well in the full Zoom range that is of

course within all the limitations of the

current testing method

if you made it this far into the video

you're probably more than averagely

interested in Optics so for this last

part I thought I'd present measurements

that I did on microscope objectives all

objectives presented here are so called

Infinity corrected objectives and this

means that they are designed to work in

combination with a so-called tube lens

rather than create an image directly

like is the case with proximity

corrected objectives

since Infinity corrected objectives

basically project their image at

Infinity this allows us to correctly use

the outer collimation configuration for

testing

unlike camera lenses microscope

objectives aren't specified by focal

length and maximal focal distance to

aperture ratio instead they're

characterized by magnification and

numerical aperture and I'll very briefly

discuss these two aspects first

magnification describes the ratio

between the object size and the image

size that a particular microscope

objective is designed for you can of

course try to use it at a different

magnification by changing both the lens

object distance and the lens image

distance but if you do that it will not

perform optimally and this is important

because microscope Optics is required to

work close to the theoretical best

performance

so in this sense a microscope objective

is a bit different from a camera lens

which is basically designed to give you

acceptable image quality over a wide

range of object to lens distances

now specifying a high magnification is

only useful if the sharpness in the

image keeps up with the magnification

that is specified and that is why the

magnification and numerical aperture of

objectives are related because numerical

aperture is a key parameter for

resolving small features

by definition the numerical aperture is

equal to the refractive index of the

medium that contains the object times

the sine of the maximum angle Theta at

which light originating from the object

can be captured this means that

numerical aperture increases with the

refractive index of the medium and with

the value of theta

now since all the objectives I will

discuss today are intended for using air

and not in water or oil we can simplify

things because the refractive index of

air is around one

so for now we can just ignore the

refractive index which means that the

numerical aperture in all cases

discussed here is just equal to the sine

of theta

the exact reason why numerical aperture

is the key parameter for achieving a

high sharpness is quite fascinating but

it's kind of a rabbit hole which I don't

want to dive in now

today I will just show you the formula

so the size of the smallest features

that can theoretically be resolved by a

microscope objective are proportional to

a constant times the wavelength of light

divided by the numerical aperture and

this means that it's possible to resolve

smaller features by either using a

shorter wavelength of light or use a

higher numerical aperture

this relationship explains why

magnification and numerical aperture are

so closely related in the specification

of microscope objectives because

attempting to pair a high magnification

with a low numerical aperture is pretty

useless it will just result in a

magnified image of pore sharpness

let's have a look at the measurements on

this Nikon 10 times objective with a

numerical aperture of 0.3 here is an

image of the wavefront error of this

objective and it shows us that the

errors are in fact very small the

wavefront is accurate within seven

hundredths of a wavelength for the

entire aperture and this Trail is 0.99

which is looking great so the major

contribution of the surface area is

actually a very slight spherical

aberration but all in all it's really a

top quality piece

now let's examine a different objective

like this 20 times Leica flu or tar with

a numerical aperture of 0.5 and do the

same waveform measurement

interestingly the spherical aberration

in this objective is noticeably more

pronounced both the peaked Valley Arrow

as well as a strail ratio is only just

on the good side of the diffraction

limit now it might be tempting to

conclude that this objective is not as

good as the previous one but that's

actually not the case the reason behind

the spherical aberration is in this

particular number that can be found on

the objective the number represents the

optimum coverslip thickness in

millimeters for this objective

so what the manufacturer assumes is that

you're going to use a glass coverslip

when you use your microscope and it has

therefore already compensated the

optical properties for a specific glass

thickness

now you might think huh 0.70 millimeters

of glass thickness how is that ever

going to influence the focus and indeed

with low numerical aperture Optics there

will generally not be a problem however

with increasing numerical aperture even

a gloss plate this thin can introduce a

significant spherical abrasion this is

Illustrated in this Ray tracing figure

for a numerical aperture of 0.7 in a

perfect optic all rays will end in a

single point but add a cover gloss and

certainly the area where the Rays end up

has significant size

now of course the previous waveform

measurement was done without a cover

slip so the question is what happens if

we add a cover slip in the light path I

quickly try this with a gloss thickness

of 0.60 millimeters so quite close to

the optimum value and it resulted in

this measurement it reduced the

spherical aberration quite a bit and so

this is something to realize when you

use a high numerical aperture objective

that it can only perform at its Peak

Performance when used in combination

with the cover slip thickness specified

so a few years ago I bought this

unmarked Nikon 20 times blonde Apple OEM

objective for use in my maskless wafer

stepper these Nikon objectives can be

purchased on eBay for around a hundred

dollars a piece and are widely available

it was in perfect shape when it got here

but when I started using it something

was a bit off depending on how I use it

exactly

now when I published the video on the

Master's waiver stepper people at the

Forum called photo

macrography.net made me aware of the

fact that these particular types of

objectives aren't optically the same as

the corresponding standard Nikon

microscope objectives they're actually

modified versions that are designed for

a different cover slip thickness

the forms that on this subject mentioned

that these perform better when used in

combination with two or three cover

slips and since I now have an

interferometer available let's see if we

can narrow this value down a bit further

here is the spherical aberration of the

objective without a cover slip the

wavefront error is one lobda so without

a correction it will certainly perform

very poorly

and here I summarize the individual

wavefront measurements for zero

one two

three and four cover slips

I think the effect of adding more glass

is pretty clear

now you can see that the wavefront error

sort of flips over between two and three

coverslips of glass thickness

now what we can do is take for example

the peak to Value spherical abrasion

from these measurements and plot the

values as a function of the glass

thickness in a graph and by fitting a

line through these data we find that a

minimum aberration is found at around

0.42 or 0.43 millimeters and this

thickness is right between two and three

copper slips like was stated on the

Forum here is a similar graph that I

made for the maximum still ratio which

actually yields exactly the same outcome

so if we were to add 0.42 millimeters of

glass sheet when using it we can

effectively get rid of the huge

spherical aberration completely and use

this objective at its maximum

performance level again

okay we finally come to the end of the

video I hope I gave you some ideas of

how interferometry can be used for

optical testing anyway thanks for
