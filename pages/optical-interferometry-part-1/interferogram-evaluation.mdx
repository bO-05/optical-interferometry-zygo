# Interferogram Evaluation

Visual evaluation of interferograms is a crucial step in determining surface shape and errors using optical interferometry. By analyzing the interference patterns captured by the interferometer, we can extract valuable information about the optical surfaces being tested.

## Understanding Interference Patterns

Interference patterns in an interferogram are created by the combination of two wavefronts: the reference wavefront and the test wavefront. The resulting pattern consists of alternating light and dark fringes, which represent constructive and destructive interference, respectively.

The shape and spacing of the fringes provide information about the difference in shape between the reference surface and the surface under test.

Some common interference patterns include:

- **Straight, equally-spaced fringes**: Indicate the presence of two flat surfaces or two curved surfaces with the same radius of curvature, tilted with respect to each other.
- **Curved fringes**: Result from the interference between a flat wavefront and a spherical wavefront, or two spherical wavefronts with different radii of curvature.

## Evaluating Interferograms

To evaluate an interferogram visually, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Identify the fringe pattern

Observe the shape and spacing of the fringes in the interferogram. Determine whether the fringes are straight, curved, or a combination of both.

### Step 2: Assess the fringe orientation and density

The orientation of the fringes indicates the direction of the wedge or tilt between the two surfaces. The density of the fringes (number of fringes per unit distance) is related to the magnitude of the wedge or the difference in curvature between the surfaces.

### Step 3: Examine fringe curvature

If the fringes are curved, evaluate the degree of curvature. This provides information about the difference in radius between the two surfaces. The deviation of the fringes from straight lines can be measured in terms of wavelengths or nanometers.

### Step 4: Interpret the results

Based on the fringe pattern, orientation, density, and curvature, draw conclusions about the surface shape and errors. Keep in mind that the observed interference pattern only provides information about the differences in wavefront shape, not the absolute shape of either surface.

## Examples

Here are some examples of interferograms and their interpretations:

1. **Linear, equally-spaced fringes**: Indicates a wedge between two flat surfaces or two spherical surfaces with the same radius of curvature.

2. **Circular fringes**: Suggests a difference in curvature between a flat surface and a spherical surface, or two spherical surfaces with different radii of curvature.

3. **Complex fringe patterns**: May indicate the presence of higher-order aberrations, such as astigmatism or coma, in the surface under test.

For more advanced analysis and quantitative measurements, consider using software tools like [DFT Fringe](/optical-interferometry-part-2/dft-fringe-software) to process the interferograms and generate detailed wavefront maps.

By mastering the art of interferogram evaluation, you can gain valuable insights into the quality and characteristics of optical surfaces, enabling you to optimize their performance in various applications.
