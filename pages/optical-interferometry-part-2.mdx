# Optical Interferometry Part 2

In the [previous section](/optical-interferometry-part-1), we discussed the principles of optical interferometry and the layout of a Zygo GPI LC interferometer. In this section, we will demonstrate how to use the interferometer to accurately measure the surface shapes and optical properties of various components, including mirrors, lenses, and microscope objectives.

To enhance the capabilities of the interferometer, we will first [modify the camera](/optical-interferometry-part-2/camera-modification) by replacing the original low-resolution camera with a modern IP camera. This upgrade will allow us to capture high-resolution interferograms for more detailed analysis.

Next, we will introduce [DFT Fringe software](/optical-interferometry-part-2/dft-fringe-software), a powerful tool for wavefront analysis. This software will enable us to quantify aberrations and evaluate the optical performance of the components under test.

With the upgraded setup, we will proceed to test various optical components:

1. [Testing Optical Surfaces](/optical-interferometry-part-2/testing-optical-surfaces): We will measure the surface properties of a high-quality concave wafer scanner mirror and assess its accuracy.

2. [Testing Camera Lenses](/optical-interferometry-part-2/testing-camera-lenses): We will evaluate the wavefront quality of both vintage and modern camera lenses, comparing their performance and identifying any aberrations.

3. [Testing Microscope Objectives](/optical-interferometry-part-2/testing-microscope-objectives): We will measure the optical properties and aberrations of various microscope objectives, discussing the impact of numerical aperture and cover slip thickness on their performance.

By the end of this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use an interferometer to characterize the optical properties of various components. This knowledge is essential for optical engineers, technicians, and researchers working in fields such as precision manufacturing, quality control, and scientific instrumentation.
