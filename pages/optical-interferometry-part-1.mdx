# Optical Interferometry Part 1

In this section, we dive deeper into the principles behind optical interferometry and explore the layout of a Zygo GPI LC interferometer from the 1990s. We'll cover the following topics:

- [Wavefronts and Coherence](/optical-interferometry-part-1/wavefronts-and-coherence): Understanding the concept of wavefronts, monochromatic light, and coherence length in interferometry.
- [Zygo Interferometer Layout](/optical-interferometry-part-1/zygo-interferometer-layout): A detailed look at the components and functionality of the Zygo GPI LC interferometer.
- [Interferogram Evaluation](/optical-interferometry-part-1/interferogram-evaluation): Visual evaluation of interferograms to determine surface shape and errors.

Optical interferometry is a powerful technique for measuring the properties of optical components and systems with nanometer-scale precision. It works by analyzing the interference patterns created when two or more wavefronts combine.

Interferometry is an indispensable tool for anyone involved in optical fabrication, as the quality of your optics is ultimately limited by the quality of your testing methods.

The Zygo GPI LC interferometer, despite being from the 1990s, is a high-quality instrument capable of measuring surface shapes and optical system performance with incredible accuracy. Its key features include:

- A helium-neon laser with a coherence length of over 100 meters
- High-quality optical components for precise wavefront manipulation
- A transmission sphere for testing spherical surfaces
- Alignment cameras for easy setup of the optics under test

In the following subsections, we'll explore the fundamental concepts behind interferometry and take a closer look at the Zygo interferometer's layout and operation. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how interferometry works and how it can be applied to characterize optical surfaces and systems.
