# Introduction to Optical Interferometry

Optical interferometry is a powerful technique used to measure the properties of optical components and systems with incredible precision. By analyzing interference patterns created by the interaction of light waves, interferometry enables us to detect surface irregularities, measure optical surface shapes, and evaluate the performance of lenses and mirrors with nanometer-level accuracy.

In this two-part series, we will explore the principles behind optical interferometry and demonstrate its practical applications using a Zygo GPI LC interferometer from the 1990s. We will cover the following topics:

## Key Concepts

To understand optical interferometry, it is essential to grasp the following key concepts:

- **Wavefronts**: A wavefront is a continuous set of points that have identical phase in an optical wave. The shape of a wavefront is always perpendicular to the local direction of wave propagation.

- **Monochromatic light**: Interferometry requires the use of monochromatic light, which has a single wavelength. Lasers and low-pressure sodium lamps are common sources of monochromatic light.

- **Coherence length**: The coherence length is the distance over which the phase of a wave remains predictable. Light sources with a narrow spectral bandwidth, such as lasers, have a long coherence length, making them ideal for interferometry.

- **Interference patterns**: When two wavefronts interact, they create an interference pattern consisting of bright and dark fringes. The intensity variations in the interference pattern contain information about the difference in shape between the reference surface and the surface under test.

## Applications of Optical Interferometry

Optical interferometry finds applications in various fields, including:

- Optical fabrication and testing
- Precision metrology
- Surface roughness measurement
- Astronomical instrumentation
- Semiconductor manufacturing
