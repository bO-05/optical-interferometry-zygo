hey everyone

today I want to demonstrate how the zygo

interferometer that I bought a few

months ago can be used to test Optics in

the previous video I explained how

interferometry Works what a wavefront is

and discuss the layout of the instrument

if you're unfamiliar with interferometry

and you haven't seen the previous video

it might be a good idea to watch that

one first

this video became quite long so here's

an overview of the contents which allows

you to skip ahead if you don't want to

watch everything first I'll show how I

replace the original low resolution

camera of the zygote with a modern IP

camera to record high resolution

interferograms and then we'll take a

quick look at how we can use the camera

in combination with the software called

DFT Fringe to create detailed wavefront

maps

the interferometer came with a reference

transmission sphere but unfortunately

the waveform documentation of this item

was missing so to do meaningful

measurements with it we first need to

establish its accuracy by performing a

calibration and with that done we can

test some actual Optics we'll examine

the surface properties of a high quality

concave wafer scanner mirror from the

1970s then we'll take a look at the

wavefront quality of a vintage Canon F

1.2 lens from the early 1980s will do

the same for a modern full-frame Canon

EF zoom lens and in the last part of the

video I'll show you measurements on the

optical properties of a couple of

microscope objectives all in all there's

quite a lot to cover so let's Dive Right

In

as shown in the previous video the

interferometer is a somewhat basic

version that displayed low resolution

black and white images on a monitor for

visual evaluation the instrument

contained two cameras one for the

alignment of the Optics under test and

one for displaying the interferogram

both cameras had a rather limited

resolution of 320 times 240 pixels now

since this is not 1996 anymore we can

now do quite a bit better than that

for the new camera to record the

interferograms I wanted to use a housed

camera with some kind of Mount to be

able to attach various types of lenses

and if you look at the layout of the

instrument there's actually plenty of

space to place such a camera in the

instrument right here we just need to

redirect the light in the horizontal

Direction so what I did was remove the

old camera and the lens and then made a

bracket that can hold a first surface

mirror under 45 degrees and this mirror

redirects the vertical beam to a

horizontal one which can then be

captured by the camera I tried different

kinds of lenses and eventually settled

on this compact 25 millimeter C mount

lens that works for most situations it's

able to capture the full field of the

interferometer while at the same time

covering a fairly large area of the

camera chip but of course for specific

measurements it's possible to use other

lenses like lenses with a longer focal

length or a variable zoom lens and this

can be very useful if you want to take a

look at small details in interferograms

by the way I left the original alignment

camera where it was because it still

works fine and you actually don't need a

lot of resolution to do the alignment

so the original monitor is still used in

the setup but only during alignment

procedures

for powering the IP camera I connected

it to a 12 volt power supply already

present in the instrument and after that

there was just one more thing to do and

that was bringing the camera's UTP

connection to the housing of the

instrument and for this purpose I used a

two-sided UTP female connector one side

connects to the camera the other side

connects to a PC and with that the

conversion is complete

now I used an IDs ethernet camera for

the conversion but in fact any camera

will do as long as it can be accessed

from a computer and the images can be

stored to disk so to capture the data

what I do is I align the optic to be

measured such that a clear interferogram

is visible with well-defined fringes it

helps if the camera software has a

feature to monitor the maximum Fringe

intensity so that we can adjust it to

within the linear dynamic range of the

camera then I collect the number of

interferograms with somewhat different

Fringe angles and spacings and these can

then serve as the basis for a wavefront

analysis

for the actual wavefront calculations

we'll use a free software called DFT

Fringe it's programmed by Dale Eason who

took it upon himself to make advanced

interferometry accessible to the masses

it's designed with amateur telescoping

in mind but as will become clear its

application range is quite a bit broader

than that I won't delve into all the

functionality of the software instead

I'll just very quickly walk you through

the process of evaluating interferograms

and averaging wavefronts

so here is the start screen of DFT

Fringe and before you can evaluate the

inferiograms correctly a program

requires the input of a few settings

like what wavelength is used and what

The Fringe spacing in the interferogram

actually represents now in some

configurations each Fringe represents

one wavelength of phase shift but in

others like in Auto collimation this

value actually needs to be set to 0.5

and when all the parameters are set

we're basically ready to go

the software gets us to our results in a

few steps you start by importing a

recorded interferogram and Define the

areas you wish to include or exclude in

the wavefront evaluation

if that's done the software performs a

2d Fourier transform on the selected

area and allows us to do a bit of low

frequency spatial filtering this

filtering can for example remove low

spatial frequencies that are the result

of the global intensity variations due

to an even illumination over the full

surface and after setting the low

frequency spatial filtering the image is

resampled to a specific size and from

this the software calculates the

waveform data

when the software calculates the

wavefront it also fits the data to a

specific set of known aberrations this

feature allows for removing specific

aberrations from your analysis for

example tilt is generally not an

aberration of interest because it

describes the orientation between the

reference and the wavefront under test

and so it has nothing to do with the

shape of either surface now DFD Fringe

allows you to either include or exclude

it from your analysis

you can customize the presentation of

the results and the scale you can also

for example convert wavefront errors to

surface shape errors and choose to

represent them in nanometers instead of

waves all in all this is a very useful

tool for interferometric Fringe analysis

and on top of that it can be downloaded

for free

in all the upcoming experiments I will

use this F 0.75 transmission sphere as a

reference and as I mentioned in the

introduction we don't know anything

about its accuracy of shape so before we

can measure any meaningful results with

it we need to measure the accuracy of

the reference sphere first but how do we

do that we could of course calibrate the

surface of the transmission sphere by

comparing its shape to a more precise

reference surface but instead I want to

show you another method known as the

random Ball Method

the method requires the use of a small

smooth ball with a reflective surface

the surface of the ball doesn't need to

be perfectly spherical but I guess it

helps if it's quite close to spherical

now the only thing we need to do for the

experiment is to measure the surface

shape of the ball at many random

positions with the reference sphere and

then average these measurements now the

reason that this works is that if you

collect a lot of samples from a bowl

surface even if it's far from perfect

all the errors in the individual parts

of the surface will eventually average

out and the average will iterate to a

surface equivalent of a perfect sphere

and when you get to that point the only

error that remains is the surface error

in the reference sphere because it's

systematically present in all the

individual measurements

you can buy these special high accuracy

silicon carbide balls for this purpose

and these are pretty expensive however

there's a much cheaper way I just used a

Precision aluminum oxide bearing ball

that typically costs less than let's say

25 Euros online

the largest balls generally have a

diameter of around 10 millimeters and

have a variation in the diameter of

about one micron so they're not

incredibly precise but as you will see

precise enough for this experiment

to hold the ball I made a stand from

three quarter inch bearing balls glued

on top of an aluminum rod using epoxy

and now we have a calibration setup

ready for less than 30 Euros

calibration procedure itself involves

placing this ball at the center of the

radius of curvature of the transmission

sphere in some random orientation we

record an interferogram then choose a

different random area on the ball record

another one and so on

and here is what evaluating the results

looks like in Practice What You observe

is that in the individual measurements

the surface area is generally larger

than a quarter of lobda and it's

actually all over the place and this is

due to the errors present in the shape

of the ball but look what happens when

we start averaging these measurements

after 10 measurements the error has

basically dropped down to a tenth of a

lobda peaked Valley and by adding more

and more measurements to the average we

can gradually bring this down even

further until after evaluating about 50

interferograms we do not see Improvement

anymore in the result and at that point

we know that the error that remains is

basically the error in the transmission

sphere reference

if we look at the accuracy of shape in

the spherical reference it's about 1

20th of a wavelength peaked Valley and

we will consider this to be the

wavefront accuracy over the full area of

the transmission sphere

now in all the upcoming tests we will

only use a small fraction of this

reference surface which will make the

accuracy of the tests quite a bit higher

than 1 20th of a lot

DFD Fringe presents the value of the

strail ratio quite prominently and I

actually discussed sterile ratio in

another video I must admit still ratio

is not the most common parameter used in

the specification of the optical quality

of for example lenses but for specifying

wavefront performance close to the

diffraction limit I think it's a very

useful parameter what it describes is

basically just the ratio between where

wave energy actually ends up in the

image compared to where it should have

ended up if the optic were perfect

so here's a graph of an intensity

profile of an imperfect optic and of a

perfect optic now to calculate this

Trail we take the area that is under

both curves and name it B and then

divide this by the area under the

perfect curve so area a and this

represents the fraction of the light

energy that goes where it should have

gone in an image

since Trail ratio is a fraction its

value is between 0 and 1 and the value

of 1 only applies to an object that

performs at the theoretical limit now

roughly speaking an optic with a trail

ratio value above 0.83 is considered to

be diffraction Limited what this doesn't

mean is that the optic is performing

perfectly in this region it just means

that the dominant factor for reduced

sharpness is because of diffraction for

example because of a limited aperture

and to a lesser degrees due to

imperfections and things like a surface

shape so in a sense the value of 0.83 is

similar to stating that a quarter

overlapped up Peak to Value wavefront

error is diffraction limited because

both these values are kind of arbitrary

definitions of what is meant by

diffraction Limited

so our reference surface turns out to be

very accurate as we can conclude from

both this Trail value as well as from

the peak to Valley wavefront error but

of course that is kind of essential if

you want to use it to measure Optical

quality of other objects in the high end

of the range

the first thing we're going to measure

is the surface shape of this spherical

zero deer mirror it's about 250

millimeters in diameter and it has a

radius of curvature of 350 millimeters I

bought the mirror about 10 years ago on

eBay for around 100 euros the reflective

coating was in pretty bad shape so I

removed it but the remaining surface

reflectivity is four percent which is

ideal in this test setup the mirror

itself is from a 1970s broken Elmer

wafer scanner system and this was the

first commercial photolithographic

system that used non-contact exposure of

silicon Wafers so given its original

application you'd expect this mirror to

be quite accurate

the way we measure this mirror is with

the focus of the reference element in

the center of the radius of curvature of

the mirror so the tightly focused Light

Beam from the interferometer expands and

then reflects off the mirror surface and

then returns along approximately the

same path and is recombined with the

spherical reference wavefront that

reflects off the reference element and

any deviations from spherical in the

mirror surface will cause phase shifts

between the light reflecting of the

mirror surface and the spherical

reference and this can then be observed

as interference

here are a few typical interferograms

that were measured with this mirror

under a slight tilt and even though the

mirror is strongly curved you can

observe that in the measurements it only

covers about half the diameter of the

total measurement area available this

makes our accuracy of measurement much

higher than a 20th of a wavelength

so from the interferograms just

collected the waveform differences

between the mirror surface and that of

the reference element is calculated in

DFD Fringe and you can see that the peak

to Value accuracy of this mirror itself

is around one tenth of a wavelength now

in terms of surface shape accuracy this

means that the mirror never deviates

more than around 30 nanometers of that

of a perfect sphere

anyway being able to measure with this

level of precision is actually pretty

cool and it gave me confidence that the

instrument performs as expected

by the way if you've ever tried to make

a telescope Mirror by hand yourself you

might observe something familiar in the

wavefront plot The Mirror Has a slightly

turned down Edge although this one's

very small around 15 nanometers or so

next on the list of items to test is

this Canon FD 55 millimeter F 1.2 lens

this is a rather famous vintage lens in

the sense that it was actually the first

consumer lens containing an aspherical

element

with its F 1.2 aperture it's very light

sensitive and therefore well suited for

indoor photography without using a flash

the earliest versions of this lens

introduced in 1971 contained radioactive

thorium oxide but this one which was

bought by my father in March of 1980

does not contain thorium therefore it

also does not display the characteristic

radiation Browning observed in

radioactive lenses and on top of that it

has lift in the Box most of it's live so

it's a nearly pristine condition

for testing the waveform deformation in

this lens we utilize a configuration

called Auto collimation which is

schematically depicted here because the

light passes through the lens twice in

this test many aberrations are measured

to be twice as large as they would be

with a single pass so when this

configuration is used it requires us to

interpret The Fringe spacing as

equivalent to only 0.5 wavelength

instead of one wavelength

before I show you the results of the

measurement I should mention that doing

away front measurement on a lens is not

in any way representative for overall

lens performance basically we're testing

with only one particular wavelength of

light on the optical axis with the focus

setting to Infinity so factors like

chromatic aberrations of axis

performance in the image field and at

proximity are not included in this test

I've actually made a video on how to

quantitatively measure all these aspects

using another method and obtain a more

holistic performance but even with all

the limitations I think it's worthwhile

to take a look at the wavefront error

that this lens introduces

so here is the wavefront error of the

lens at its full aperture and as you can

see it's actually pretty large the total

peaked Valley wavefront error is more

than three lobda and the most apparent

errors are spherical aberration and some

astigmatism

the streel ratio is actually quite

disappointing as well

now as a consequence this lens can never

provide High sharpness images at the

maximum aperture

now it's interesting to see what happens

if we limit the aperture of this lens to

let's say F4 and by doing that we'll

lose a lot of light about 90 percent but

this also limits the wavefront error to

the one present in this central part

here so if we do the same wavefront

analysis at F4 suddenly the lens

performs the fraction limited because

reducing aperture to F4 eliminates

almost all of the spherical error and

astigmatism which is present in the

wavefront at full aperture

here's a comparison of the text on a

permanent marker shot with f 1.2 and f4

on an aps-c sensor it's clear that the

three laptop wavefront arrow is

influencing the sharpness and contrast

pretty badly so I guess the only way to

use this lens effectively is to always

set it to a smaller aperture whenever

there's sufficient light available

otherwise you'll end up with very soft

images

the Canon EF 24 to 105 millimeters full

frame zoom lens is next on our list I

just want to take a very brief look at

it mainly because I sometimes use it for

my YouTube videos with its maximum

aperture of f4 over the whole Zoom range

it's not particularly Photon hungry but

it always produces excellent image

sharpness which made me curious about

how small the wavefront errors in a high

quality lens actually are

it was measured in the same way as the F

1.2 lens so in outer collimation and

here are the wavefront errors at the

focal length settings of 24 millimeters

50 millimeters and 105 millimeters the

largest waveform errors are found at 105

millimeters focal distance where this

Trail ratio has dropped to 0.6 which by

the way is still a very decent value for

a lens

in the center of the range its

performance is basically diffraction

limited so concluding this lens performs

well in the full Zoom range that is of

course within all the limitations of the

current testing method

if you made it this far into the video

you're probably more than averagely

interested in Optics so for this last

part I thought I'd present measurements

that I did on microscope objectives all

objectives presented here are so called

Infinity corrected objectives and this

means that they are designed to work in

combination with a so-called tube lens

rather than create an image directly

like is the case with proximity

corrected objectives

since Infinity corrected objectives

basically project their image at

Infinity this allows us to correctly use

the outer collimation configuration for

testing

unlike camera lenses microscope

objectives aren't specified by focal

length and maximal focal distance to

aperture ratio instead they're

characterized by magnification and

numerical aperture and I'll very briefly

discuss these two aspects first

magnification describes the ratio

between the object size and the image

size that a particular microscope

objective is designed for you can of

course try to use it at a different

magnification by changing both the lens

object distance and the lens image

distance but if you do that it will not

perform optimally and this is important

because microscope Optics is required to

work close to the theoretical best

performance

so in this sense a microscope objective

is a bit different from a camera lens

which is basically designed to give you

acceptable image quality over a wide

range of object to lens distances

now specifying a high magnification is

only useful if the sharpness in the

image keeps up with the magnification

that is specified and that is why the

magnification and numerical aperture of

objectives are related because numerical

aperture is a key parameter for

resolving small features

by definition the numerical aperture is

equal to the refractive index of the

medium that contains the object times

the sine of the maximum angle Theta at

which light originating from the object

can be captured this means that

numerical aperture increases with the

refractive index of the medium and with

the value of theta

now since all the objectives I will

discuss today are intended for using air

and not in water or oil we can simplify

things because the refractive index of

air is around one

so for now we can just ignore the

refractive index which means that the

numerical aperture in all cases

discussed here is just equal to the sine

of theta

the exact reason why numerical aperture

is the key parameter for achieving a

high sharpness is quite fascinating but

it's kind of a rabbit hole which I don't

want to dive in now

today I will just show you the formula

so the size of the smallest features

that can theoretically be resolved by a

microscope objective are proportional to

a constant times the wavelength of light

divided by the numerical aperture and

this means that it's possible to resolve

smaller features by either using a

shorter wavelength of light or use a

higher numerical aperture

this relationship explains why

magnification and numerical aperture are

so closely related in the specification

of microscope objectives because

attempting to pair a high magnification

with a low numerical aperture is pretty

useless it will just result in a

magnified image of pore sharpness

let's have a look at the measurements on

this Nikon 10 times objective with a

numerical aperture of 0.3 here is an

image of the wavefront error of this

objective and it shows us that the

errors are in fact very small the

wavefront is accurate within seven

hundredths of a wavelength for the

entire aperture and this Trail is 0.99

which is looking great so the major

contribution of the surface area is

actually a very slight spherical

aberration but all in all it's really a

top quality piece

now let's examine a different objective

like this 20 times Leica flu or tar with

a numerical aperture of 0.5 and do the

same waveform measurement

interestingly the spherical aberration

in this objective is noticeably more

pronounced both the peaked Valley Arrow

as well as a strail ratio is only just

on the good side of the diffraction

limit now it might be tempting to

conclude that this objective is not as

good as the previous one but that's

actually not the case the reason behind

the spherical aberration is in this

particular number that can be found on

the objective the number represents the

optimum coverslip thickness in

millimeters for this objective

so what the manufacturer assumes is that

you're going to use a glass coverslip

when you use your microscope and it has

therefore already compensated the

optical properties for a specific glass

thickness

now you might think huh 0.70 millimeters

of glass thickness how is that ever

going to influence the focus and indeed

with low numerical aperture Optics there

will generally not be a problem however

with increasing numerical aperture even

a gloss plate this thin can introduce a

significant spherical abrasion this is

Illustrated in this Ray tracing figure

for a numerical aperture of 0.7 in a

perfect optic all rays will end in a

single point but add a cover gloss and

certainly the area where the Rays end up

has significant size

now of course the previous waveform

measurement was done without a cover

slip so the question is what happens if

we add a cover slip in the light path I

quickly try this with a gloss thickness

of 0.60 millimeters so quite close to

the optimum value and it resulted in

this measurement it reduced the

spherical aberration quite a bit and so

this is something to realize when you

use a high numerical aperture objective

that it can only perform at its Peak

Performance when used in combination

with the cover slip thickness specified

so a few years ago I bought this

unmarked Nikon 20 times blonde Apple OEM

objective for use in my maskless wafer

stepper these Nikon objectives can be

purchased on eBay for around a hundred

dollars a piece and are widely available

it was in perfect shape when it got here

but when I started using it something

was a bit off depending on how I use it

exactly

now when I published the video on the

Master's waiver stepper people at the

Forum called photo

macrography.net made me aware of the

fact that these particular types of

objectives aren't optically the same as

the corresponding standard Nikon

microscope objectives they're actually

modified versions that are designed for

a different cover slip thickness

the forms that on this subject mentioned

that these perform better when used in

combination with two or three cover

slips and since I now have an

interferometer available let's see if we

can narrow this value down a bit further

here is the spherical aberration of the

objective without a cover slip the

wavefront error is one lobda so without

a correction it will certainly perform

very poorly

and here I summarize the individual

wavefront measurements for zero

one two

three and four cover slips

I think the effect of adding more glass

is pretty clear

now you can see that the wavefront error

sort of flips over between two and three

coverslips of glass thickness

now what we can do is take for example

the peak to Value spherical abrasion

from these measurements and plot the

values as a function of the glass

thickness in a graph and by fitting a

line through these data we find that a

minimum aberration is found at around

0.42 or 0.43 millimeters and this

thickness is right between two and three

copper slips like was stated on the

Forum here is a similar graph that I

made for the maximum still ratio which

actually yields exactly the same outcome

so if we were to add 0.42 millimeters of

glass sheet when using it we can

effectively get rid of the huge

spherical aberration completely and use

this objective at its maximum

performance level again

okay we finally come to the end of the

video I hope I gave you some ideas of

how interferometry can be used for

optical testing anyway thanks for
