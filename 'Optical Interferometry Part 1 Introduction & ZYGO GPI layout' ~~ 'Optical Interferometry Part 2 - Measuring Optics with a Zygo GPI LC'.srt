# Optical Interferometry Part 1 - Introduction & ZYGO GPI layout

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,799
hey everyone today I want to talk about

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,740
Optical interferometry a method that is

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,000
frequently used to measure the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
properties of optical components and

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,240
systems

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
what initially made me want to do a

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,619
video about this subject is this zygo

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,840
interferometer that I bought a while ago

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,980
secondhand

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,840
a new instrument of this type is

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,060
financially far out of my reach and I

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,680
must admit that this one wasn't a

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
bargain either but the thing is I wanted

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,359
to own a high quality interferometer for

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,940
a long time if only to get away from the

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,100
do-it-yourself setups that I've used so

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,320
far and since these instruments are not

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,719
abundantly available secondhand I just

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,239
had to take this rare opportunity to buy

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
one

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
in case you have no idea what this

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,820
instrument is with it you can very

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,000
accurately measure the shape of flat and

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
spherical Optical interfaces like the

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,559
ones you find on lenses and mirrors and

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,960
with accurately I mean in the nanometer

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,860
range

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,780
but not only that you can also measure

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,640
the performance of complete Optical

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,700
systems so a good interferometer is an

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,860
indispensable tool for anyone involved

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,020
in Optical fabrication because in the

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,540
end the quality of your Optics is mainly

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,119
limited by the quality of your testing

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,400
methods

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,439
this particular instrument was produced

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,580
by zygo in August of 1996 it was sold to

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
Philips Electronics in Eindhoven where

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,540
it was used to check the surface shape

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,299
of lenses of special Optical disk drives

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,759
from what I understood some of these

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,100
lenses were produced from small polished

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
glass balls and these were cut in pieces

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
and then transformed into very short

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,400
focal distance lenses now at some point

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,680
the activity was transferred to a

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,140
Phillips spin-off called anterion and

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,880
the interferometer was sold to an

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,040
employee who basically stored it for a

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,960
couple of years he then sold it to me

51
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
together with a black and white Monitor

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,340
and the transmission sphere that was

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,799
used to test the lenses

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,079
in this video I'll first discuss the

55
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,420
principle behind interferometry and then

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
we'll take a look at the layout of the

57
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,140
instrument and how it works exactly and

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,419
in an upcoming video I'll show you how I

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,038
pimped the instrument a bit with a

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,080
modern CCD camera

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
as I said earlier in Optics manufacturer

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,879
interferometry is a frequently used

63
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,040
method to characterize both Optical

64
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
surfaces as well as complete systems and

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
the method is based on analyzing

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,280
interference patterns and extract

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,319
so-called wavefront information from

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
them and I will discuss the meaning of

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,599
the word wavefront in a second

70
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,920
interferometry is an extremely sensitive

71
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,080
and accurate method that can be used to

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,819
establish the general shape of an

73
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,519
interface but also things like waviness

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,580
or even surface roughness it does also

75
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,800
have some limitations the measurement

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,620
ranges generally fairly limited to

77
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,800
several microns also it's unsuitable for

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,319
interfaces that contain sharp step-like

79
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,420
height features because these cannot be

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,060
unambiguously identified and so in

81
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,519
general interferometry is most accurate

82
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,920
when the surfaces we want to test are

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,420
fairly smooth

84
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,879
now I just mentioned the word wavefront

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,000
which I think is not a trivial concept I

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
guess we've all experienced wavefronts

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,140
at some points in our lives but I'm not

88
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,959
referring to those in Optics away from

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,060
this actually a continuous set of points

90
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,420
that have identical phase so what does

91
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,459
that mean well from a classical

92
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,099
Viewpoint light is an electromagnetic

93
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,959
wave that harmonically oscillates and

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,780
propagates in space and at any given

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,180
point in this process the electric and

96
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,739
magnetic field components can be

97
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,780
described by the Maxwell equations so

98
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,760
here I've tried to schematically draw

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,220
the electromagnetic field in a somewhat

100
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,799
larger volume and if you examine the

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
phase of these waves you can identify

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,000
planes where the face of the

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,459
electromagnetic field is identical and

104
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,260
the continuous set of points that have

105
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,019
the same phase value is called away

106
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,180
front

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,760
one property of a wavefront is that its

108
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
shape is always transverse or

109
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,379
perpendicular to the local direction of

110
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,599
wave propagation here this is

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
Illustrated for a few differently shaped

112
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,040
wavefronts where the arrows indicate the

113
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,620
direction of wave propagation now in

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,540
general phase relationships for

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,760
different points in space are only well

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,160
defined when the waves have one specific

117
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,960
wavelength and if we want to do

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,540
interferometry it's vital that the light

119
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,240
we use is of one particular wavelength

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,460
which is also called monochromatic light

121
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,500
and in the rest of this video I'll

122
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,900
assume that the light used is more or

123
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,120
less monochromatic

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,460
a frequently used way to generate

125
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,680
monochromatic radiation is by means of a

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,020
laser and this is because the process of

127
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,419
stimulated emission which takes place in

128
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,820
the laser cavity favors the generation

129
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
of light in a very narrow wavelength

130
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,940
range also the wavefront exiting the

131
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,340
laser cavity is virtually flat over the

132
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,560
aperture and because the light has an

133
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,419
extremely well defined wavelength in

134
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,280
other words it has a very narrow

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
spectral bandwidth phase relationships

136
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,380
in the field exiting the laser can be

137
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,840
preserved over long distances

138
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,540
another way to say this is that lasers

139
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,940
have a long coherence length which is

140
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,220
generally between half a meter up to

141
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,860
several kilometers for certain special

142
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,080
types of lasers

143
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,940
in practice this means that if we take

144
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,699
two points A and B in the light path and

145
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,979
we look at the variations in the phase

146
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,900
difference between the two points we

147
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,120
will find that these will be relatively

148
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,340
small and the distance over which

149
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,039
variations in Phase remain acceptable is

150
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,800
called the coherence length as you can

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
see from this equation the coherence

152
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,600
length LC is inversely proportional to

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,180
the spectral bandwidth Delta Nu of the

154
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,340
light source and so light sources with a

155
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,500
very narrow emission line will generally

156
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
have a long coherence length

157
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
another source of monochromatic light

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,820
frequently used in interferometry is the

159
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,979
low pressure sodium lamp which mainly

160
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,620
generates light in a narrow emission

161
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,220
band at 589 nanometers however the

162
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,720
spectral bandwidth of the sodium

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,699
emission line is much broader than that

164
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,919
of lasers and the phase relationships

165
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,199
generally only hold over distances

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,080
smaller than a millimeter

167
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,180
now measuring the shape of a waveform

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,460
directly in the visible part of the

169
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,860
electromagnetic spectrum is not easy and

170
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
that is because of the high frequencies

171
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,139
involved for electromagnetic radiation

172
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,180
of longer wavelengths like for example

173
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,819
radio waves we can measure the phase of

174
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,039
the alternating Fields directly and that

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,780
is because the oscillations have

176
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,060
relatively low frequency say generally

177
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,580
somewhere in the mega or gigahertz range

178
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,100
and so we can point a bunch of antennas

179
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,560
to the sky measure the electromagnetic

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,419
signals that are received in each of

181
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,699
them and then establish the shape of the

182
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,100
wavefront for a particular frequency by

183
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,979
looking for phase correlations and based

184
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,199
on this information we can identify the

185
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,060
exact direction from which the radiation

186
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,620
is emitted

187
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,720
but the visible light has a frequency

188
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,699
more than a thousand times higher than

189
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,340
even the highest frequency radio waves

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,440
and for frequencies this high it's

191
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,600
technically infeasible to measure phase

192
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,340
directly for an oscillating

193
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,979
electromagnetic field

194
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,560
however what we can easily measure with

195
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,960
Optical detectors like CCD or CMOS

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,080
sensors is spatial intensity variations

197
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,599
and that is where interferometry comes

198
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,940
in instead of trying to measure the

199
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,460
phase in light directly this method

200
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,380
works by studying the interference

201
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,960
patterns resulting from the addition of

202
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,300
a second wavefront that has a known

203
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,460
shape

204
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,139
let me start by showing you a very

205
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,880
simple example of how this works in

206
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
light

207
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,580
for this experiment we need a

208
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,800
monochromatic light source and a flat

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,259
surface as a light source we'll use a

210
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,479
sodium lamp and for the surface we'll

211
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,060
use a flat Optical test glass

212
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,280
now a typical air gloss interface

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,080
reflects about four percent of the

214
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,240
incident light and with a uniform light

215
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,960
source we observe a uniform reflection

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,300
let's now place two differently shaped

217
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,039
surfaces on top of this reference

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,139
surface for evaluation and what we now

219
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,539
observe is that these objects show two

220
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,060
different interference patterns the part

221
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,099
of the left shows straight lines with

222
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,379
equal spacing and I wanted to write this

223
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,720
place these curved lines or circular

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
fringes depending on the exact surface

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,339
orientation now it's these intensity

226
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,958
variations that actually contain

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,940
detailed information about the

228
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,740
difference in shape between the

229
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,260
reference surface and the two surfaces

230
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,420
under tests and we just need to know how

231
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,779
to interpret what we see exactly

232
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,420
so what do we see well let me explain

233
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,880
with an animation I admit the following

234
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,740
is a simplification and it's not

235
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,720
correctly visualizing the physics but

236
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,600
it's actually quite illustrative here is

237
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,360
away from that has just reflected off a

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
flat reference surface so this wavefront

239
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,519
is basically also flat and so the image

240
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,399
shows a 2d cross-section of the flat

241
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,019
Optical wavefront

242
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,500
now we place a sensor in the path of the

243
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,720
light we can measure the intensity and

244
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,519
what we observe is that it's basically

245
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,320
the same everywhere and this tells us

246
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,180
exactly nothing about the shape of the

247
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,440
wavefront

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,779
now let's add a second wavefront that

249
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,940
has reflected of a second surface that

250
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,339
is slightly tilted in this example the

251
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,680
wavefront is also flat and what we

252
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,480
observe is that the intensity now

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
becomes non-uniform and this is caused

254
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,740
by constructive and destructive

255
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,720
interference between the two reflected

256
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,019
wavefronts at the second interface here

257
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,300
the electromagnetic field is the linear

258
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,060
sum of the contributions of the fields

259
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,160
of the two wavefronts and so in some

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,200
points where these contributions are

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
always in Phase they add up on the other

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,180
hand in places where the two are exactly

263
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,459
out of phase the field contributions

264
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,160
cancel each other out and if they are of

265
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,740
equal amplitude effectively the

266
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,339
resulting field becomes zero

267
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,740
in the case of two flat wavefronts we

268
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,380
will observe linear and equally spaced

269
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,600
fringes and the density of the

270
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,339
interference pattern itself is dependent

271
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,740
on the wedge or angle between the two

272
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,140
surfaces and the position of the fringes

273
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,000
is dependent on the distance between the

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,519
two surfaces now you might think that

275
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
linear and equally spaced fringes are

276
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
indicative for the presence of two flat

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,260
surfaces and that's partly correct but

278
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,080
two curved wavefronts with exactly the

279
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,060
same radius of curvature will actually

280
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,820
also display linear and equally spaced

281
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,160
fringes when displays are tilted

282
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,079
however when two waveforms have

283
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,540
different radii this results in curve

284
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,339
fringes and this is for example the case

285
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,500
when we have a flat and a spherical

286
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,779
wavefront interfering or when we have

287
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,940
two spherical waveforms that have a

288
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,860
different radius of curvature so I guess

289
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,200
it's important to realize that the

290
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
observed interference pattern only gives

291
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,120
us information about differences in

292
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,459
wavefront shape

293
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,920
the example just shown with the Sodium

294
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,019
lamp we only observe interference

295
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,640
between the interfaces when they're

296
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,920
placed very close together and that is

297
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,019
because of the limited coherence length

298
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,480
of the light so whether we can see a

299
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,519
clear interference pattern is dependent

300
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,160
on whether stable phase relationships

301
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
exists between the reflections coming

302
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,899
off the two surfaces at the point where

303
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,000
they start interfering and this means

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
that with a coherence length smaller

305
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,019
than a millimeter the surfaces need to

306
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,120
be quite close to each other in order to

307
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,300
observe interference fringes

308
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,519
now I just stated that in constructive

309
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,040
interference the electromagnetic fields

310
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,500
add up and in destructive interference

311
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,480
the two contributions cancel each other

312
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,440
out so what does this mean for intensity

313
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,480
well light intensity is equivalent to

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
the power per unit of surface and so

315
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,100
it's actually not the same thing as the

316
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,500
magnitude of the electronic field in

317
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,019
fact intensity scales with the square of

318
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,940
this field and so if we have two

319
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,700
reflections of equal magnitude say both

320
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,220
are four percent this means that for the

321
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,019
location of constructive interference

322
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,779
the intensity could be four times as

323
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,000
high and that is actually what is

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,560
generally observed in interference

325
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,959
patterns that the intensity in the

326
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,300
bright areas is much brighter than the

327
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,220
sum of the two individual intensities

328
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,800
but of course if we look on average the

329
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,959
intensity over the whole area will still

330
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,060
be equal to the sum of the two

331
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,339
individual intensities

332
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,040
anyway enough background let's return to

333
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,079
the zygote interferometer itself and

334
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,060
take a peek under the hood to see what's

335
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,920
going on inside

336
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,779
in order to do that we need to remove

337
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,240
two different Lids the outer one is made

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
of plastic and it's basically just

339
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,779
cosmetic and the second one is made out

340
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,519
of aluminum sheet metal and it is

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
intended as RF shielding for the

342
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
electronics inside

343
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,300
the first thing you notice is that it

344
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,339
isn't awfully full inside there is a

345
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,500
helium neon laser with its high voltage

346
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,420
power supply then there are a few

347
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,579
Optical components like a steering

348
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,980
mirror for a laser beam a variable

349
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,540
filter that can be moved mechanically

350
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,000
using a rod and this Rod also operates a

351
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
switch that activates either of two PCB

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,339
cameras that can also be found in this

353
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,320
top part of the interferometer

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
and the cameras by the way have CCD

355
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,480
chips of about four by six millimeter in

356
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,600
size and are fairly low resolution

357
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,120
now both cameras have lenses mounted in

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,160
front of them and one of the cameras is

359
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,320
above a tiny beam splitter and the other

360
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,480
one is above a diffuser with a Crosshair

361
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
printed on it

362
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,380
in the bottom compartment behind the lid

363
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,440
here we find the mains 12 volt DC power

364
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,380
supply a large beam splitter a mirror

365
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,839
under 45 degrees and a four inch

366
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,700
collimation lens and apart from a few

367
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,980
brackets and mounts that hold the Optics

368
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,399
together that is basically it

369
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,100
so you might wonder why was this thing

370
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,500
the price of a luxury car back in 1996

371
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,260
well apart from I suspect a healthy

372
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,839
profit margin there are several reasons

373
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,700
of course it's not really a mass

374
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,040
manufactured item but another reason is

375
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,139
that every component inside appears to

376
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,660
be of very high quality take for example

377
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,180
the helium neon laser according to the

378
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,040
label the tube has been specifically

379
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,220
selected for this type of instrument why

380
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,620
well if we look at the specification of

381
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,120
the coherence length of the

382
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,220
interferometer we see that it's larger

383
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,279
than 100 meters this means that the

384
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
wavelength variations in the laser light

385
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,480
need to be extremely low so that the

386
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,399
phase relationships hold over distances

387
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,800
of more than 100 meters now I calculated

388
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,480
what this means in terms of frequency

389
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,880
stability and found that variations in

390
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,279
the frequency of the light cannot be

391
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,440
more than 2 times 10 to the minus seven

392
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,500
percent and so this means that not just

393
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,199
any random laser will do

394
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,579
so let me take you through the

395
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,079
functionality of all the optical

396
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,560
components step by step using schematics

397
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
here is the helium mule laser which

398
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
outputs a highly coherent beam of light

399
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,920
and the direction of the beam can be

400
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,019
optimized with this small steering

401
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,880
mirror after which the beam goes through

402
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,339
a variable attenuation filter now this

403
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,199
filter allows for adjustment of the

404
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,660
general brightness of the laser beam and

405
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,279
after having passed the attenuation

406
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,800
filter the beam is going into a gradient

407
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,959
index lens which is connected to a very

408
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,480
small beam splitter

409
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,300
now a gradient index lens is a small

410
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,639
glass rod that contains a gradient in

411
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,740
refractive index that runs from the

412
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,199
center to the edge of the rod and since

413
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,000
the refractive index has the highest

414
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
value in the center the optical

415
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,440
wavefront in the laser beam is gradually

416
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,899
delayed more towards the center of the

417
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,420
rod and the waveform therefore becomes

418
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,639
curved which effectively results in

419
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,100
focusing of the light into a tight focal

420
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,800
point and after passing this focal point

421
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,320
the beam expands again into a nicely

422
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,240
spherical wavefront

423
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,699
a small beam splitter sends the

424
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,980
spherical waveform into the partially

425
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,139
reflective surface of a second much

426
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,060
larger beam splitter and this surface

427
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,860
reflects the light towards a collimation

428
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,600
lens where the light exits the

429
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,399
instrument

430
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,620
the function of the collimation lens is

431
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,899
to convert the spherical wavefront into

432
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,060
a flat wavefront of four inches in

433
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,100
diameter and this flat waveform can

434
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,019
serve as the basis for all kinds of

435
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,600
interferometric tests for example we can

436
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,820
place two partially reflective flat

437
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,459
interfaces into this output beam one

438
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,680
being the reference interface and one

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
being the interface that we'd like to

440
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,459
test for flatness and due to the large

441
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,500
coherence length of the light more than

442
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,959
100 meters these interfaces don't have

443
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,139
to be necessarily very close together

444
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,240
the light reflecting of these surfaces

445
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,339
is directed back into the interferometer

446
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,620
approximately along the same path as it

447
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,720
came from goes through a small beam

448
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,819
splitter again and then is collimated

449
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,400
and projected on the CCD chip and this

450
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,439
allows us to observe the interference

451
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,540
pattern between the two Reflections and

452
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,380
evaluate this visually on the monitor

453
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,660
now to steer the light off both the

454
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,059
reference and test surface exactly back

455
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,099
through the tiny beam splitter here is

456
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,839
pretty hard and you don't see anything

457
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,059
with camera one until things are almost

458
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,640
perfectly aligned so to make life a lot

459
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,100
easier the people at zygo edit this

460
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,380
alignment functionality to the system

461
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,539
part of the light from the reflections

462
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,120
can pass this larger beam splitter and

463
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,160
this part continues straight on it's

464
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,799
reflected at 90 degrees angle and then

465
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,140
reaches the glass diffuser plate that

466
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,480
contains a Crosshair pattern

467
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,280
because this diffuser plate is exactly

468
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
at the focal distance of the collimation

469
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,020
lens the reflections create tiny spots

470
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,760
here and their positions can be observed

471
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,520
by camera 2 that is only intended for

472
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,220
alignment purposes now this alignment

473
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,919
unit has a much larger field of view and

474
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,780
what we can do now is simply align the

475
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,120
position of the surface reflection such

476
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,980
that they are at the center of the

477
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,440
Crosshair and when that's the case the

478
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,419
system is also automatically aligned on

479
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,760
camera one we can immediately observe an

480
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,740
interferogram

481
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,660
now the interferometers that I made

482
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,760
myself did not have this kind of feature

483
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,280
and I must admit that this really makes

484
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,820
aligning Optics a piece of cake

485
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,440
here you see the location of the

486
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
collimation lens viewed from the outside

487
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,000
of the instrument in front of it is an

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,740
adjustment mechanism that is intended

489
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,559
for mounting various reference surfaces

490
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,780
to the interferometer directly like for

491
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,419
example the f.7 D5 transmission sphere

492
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,820
that came with interferometer

493
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,220
the adjustment mechanism has two degrees

494
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,380
of freedom which are tip and tilt and

495
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,000
this allows the angle of the

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,919
transmission reference to be oriented

497
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,520
with respect to the surface under test

498
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
so when testing Optical components you

499
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,720
generally test the surface shape before

500
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,660
the interfaces get coated and so in the

501
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,280
case of glosses means that they reflect

502
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,080
around four percent of the incident

503
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,860
light

504
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,020
so the transmission reference also needs

505
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,299
to reflect around four percent back into

506
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,460
the interferometer to get high contrast

507
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,860
fringes

508
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,220
not to test spherical surfaces you need

509
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,860
a spherical reference surface that

510
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,780
somehow reflects four percent of the

511
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,539
light exiting the infrometer right back

512
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,860
into the instrument

513
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,200
here I've drawn a schematic of the

514
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,179
inside of a transmission sphere assembly

515
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,940
to show you how that is achieved

516
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,559
the reference surface is the last

517
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,080
interface of the assembly here indicated

518
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,960
in yellow and all the other surfaces are

519
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,360
anti-reflection coated for the laser

520
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,559
wavelength

521
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,480
but even more importantly they're also

522
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,160
designed in such a way that the Light

523
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,500
reaches the reference interface exactly

524
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,900
perpendicular and this means that it's

525
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,059
the only interface in the transmission

526
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,460
sphere that sends a reflection back

527
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,740
where it came from and then enters the

528
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,140
interferometer as a collimated beam and

529
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,039
of course

530
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,280
96 of the light continues onto the

531
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,260
surface under test which also reflects

532
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,299
around four percent and so we observe

533
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,880
the interference occurring between these

534
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,780
two interfaces

535
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,039
with a spherical transmission reference

536
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,799
we can test convex as well as concave

537
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,340
optics for convex Optics only radii is

538
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,840
smaller than the radius of the

539
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
transmission sphere itself can be tested

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,919
and for concave Optics the only

541
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,720
limitation for the radius to be tested

542
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,700
is that it should be less than half of

543
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,740
the maximum coherence length of the

544
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,720
light source that we use which is in

545
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,460
this case 50 meters

546
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,020
now I want to save most of the

547
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,460
experiments that I had in mind for

548
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,799
another video but let's just do one

549
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,780
simple experiment for this test we'll

550
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,059
just use the flat wavefront exiting the

551
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,980
instrument and what we'll try to measure

552
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,559
is the difference in shape between the

553
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,720
two surfaces of a zero to your test

554
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Clause this test class has one side

555
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,000
which I know is very flat around 120th

556
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,919
of a wavelength and this is going to be

557
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,200
our reference interface but the other

558
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,940
side is somewhat less flat and what

559
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,919
we'll try to find out is how much that

560
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,160
is

561
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,360
the two interfaces are spaced 20

562
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,100
millimeters apart and both reflect

563
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,720
around four percent of the incident

564
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,820
light so we can just place the disc in

565
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,500
the beam exiting the interferometer

566
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,120
align the position of the two

567
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,220
Reflections simultaneously and then look

568
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,500
at the interference pattern and this is

569
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,900
what it looks like as you can see we get

570
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,880
a nice and clear interference pattern

571
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,860
which by the way is extremely stable

572
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,320
with no effects of vibrations from the

573
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
environment and that is because the two

574
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,700
surfaces are basically mechanically

575
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,679
connected to each other by a solid piece

576
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,000
of zero Doer

577
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,280
now the small circular spots are just

578
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,740
dust particles in the optical path and

579
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,419
these are not important for our

580
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:55,860
evaluation

581
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,600
all the information about the different

582
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,580
in shape and orientation between the two

583
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,340
surfaces is contained in the four more

584
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,919
or less vertical fringes and because we

585
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,840
know that one side is almost perfectly

586
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,240
flat any curvature in The Fringe pattern

587
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,940
is a result of non-flatness of the

588
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,799
second interface

589
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,900
so let's try to evaluate this pattern

590
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,419
visually the most obvious feature is of

591
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,460
course the presence of the four vertical

592
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,679
fringes that indicate that there is a

593
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,440
wedge between the two interfaces in the

594
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,659
horizontal Direction and we can evaluate

595
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,820
how large this wedge is based on the

596
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,620
number of fringes it's a little over

597
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,200
four lobda wavefront meaning that there

598
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,240
is a wedge half of that between the two

599
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,299
surfaces so just two wavelengths y half

600
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,240
well that is because in reflection any

601
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,520
deviations in surface shape lead to

602
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,919
twice the deviation in the wave front

603
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,140
shape and so deviations in the surface

604
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,840
shape are only half of that observed in

605
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,980
the wavefront

606
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,820
now since the wavelength of the laser is

607
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,159
633 nanometers and the wedge is two

608
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,380
lobbed up between the two surfaces this

609
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,780
would mean a gradient in distance of

610
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,799
approximately 1.3 microns but there is a

611
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,140
little catch in this case because we are

612
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,780
comparing two surfaces with zero during

613
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,880
between them we should actually use the

614
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,220
wavelength in this material which means

615
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,200
that we should divide the wavelength in

616
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
air or vacuum by the refractive index of

617
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,860
zero deer which is 1.54

618
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,020
so this means that the wedge is actually

619
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,039
only 840 nanometers but which side is

620
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,440
thicker it's actually quite hard to tell

621
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,140
as for which we would see the same type

622
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,940
of interference pattern in either case

623
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,539
so at this point we just don't know

624
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,640
okay let's for a moment focus on the

625
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,620
curvature of the fringes now which

626
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,780
indicates a difference in the radius

627
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,059
between the two surfaces and if we look

628
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,280
at how much the curvature in the fringes

629
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,980
deviates from straight lines we see that

630
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,620
it's largest here in the center it's

631
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,100
about 0.4 times The Fringe spacing which

632
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,559
translates to 0.4 wavelengths of height

633
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,659
difference between the edge and the

634
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,340
center of the disc

635
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,679
for the surface error which again is

636
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,220
half of that we find 0.2 wavelengths now

637
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,200
since we also need to use the wavelength

638
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,020
inside zero do here this means that the

639
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,539
surface curvature is 0.2 times the

640
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,059
wavelength divided by the refractive

641
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,400
index which results in a value of 82

642
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
nanometers

643
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,880
but in which direction is the curve is

644
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,280
the surface under test 82 nanometers

645
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,159
concave or convex as for the direction

646
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,500
of the wedge there is no easy way to

647
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,419
tell so now we end up with these four

648
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,880
configurations of which only one can be

649
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,799
correct

650
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,080
with a little logic though you could at

651
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,820
this point already discard two of these

652
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,120
as infeasible but of course you want to

653
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,820
know exactly which configuration of the

654
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,799
four is correct right

655
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,380
so if that's indeed the case figure it

656
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,900
out yourself you just need two more

657
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,659
pieces of information here is a first

658
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,760
hint if I press my finger against the

659
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,039
back side of the disk so the service and

660
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,539
the test we can observe that the

661
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,340
interferogram changes due to the

662
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,500
temperature increase of the material by

663
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,960
the heat of my finger locally it's only

664
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,700
a few degrees Celsius higher but the

665
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,799
effect is very noticeable because we are

666
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,740
measuring in the nanometer range

667
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,659
now the second piece of information you

668
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,179
need is about the expansion coefficient

669
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,640
of the material as you can see from the

670
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,799
specifications of zero zero it can be

671
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,440
either positive or negative

672
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,659
but this piece of 02 has a positive

673
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,640
coefficient of thermal expansion which

674
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,020
means it expands with temperature

675
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,960
increase and with these two additional

676
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
pieces of information it's possible to

677
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,159
tell which of these four options is

678
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,440
correct now the first person to make a

679
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,480
comment with the correct answer and of

680
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,320
course why owns the pinned comment

681
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,419
okay so the letter was a very brief

682
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,419
explanation of how you can evaluate

683
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,740
interferograms visually and the above

684
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,779
example was actually relatively easy

685
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,179
imagine your interferogram looks

686
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,700
something like this or this in these

687
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,620
cases it would be quite a bit more

688
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,360
challenging to make accurate statements

689
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,000
about the exact surface shape

690
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,799
and this is why in the next video about

691
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,600
the subject I have replaced the current

692
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,840
analog camera with a high resolution IP

693
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,580
camera and this allows for a very

694
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,140
detailed evaluation of the

695
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,419
interferograms using software

696
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,340
with the help of this software we can

697
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,700
measure wedges angles surface curvature

698
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,279
and even the effect of warm fingers very

699
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,860
accurately also we'll take a look at how

700
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,720
to measure the shape of various Optical

701
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,059
surfaces and the quality of lens

702
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,520
assemblies so hopefully I'll see you in

703
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,360
the next video again

704
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,260
[Music]

705
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,270
thank you

706
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:06,800

707
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,700
bye bye

# Optical Interferometry Part 2 - Measuring Optics with a Zygo GPI LC


1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,399
hey everyone

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,680
today I want to demonstrate how the zygo

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,480
interferometer that I bought a few

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,720
months ago can be used to test Optics in

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,519
the previous video I explained how

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,160
interferometry Works what a wavefront is

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,980
and discuss the layout of the instrument

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,660
if you're unfamiliar with interferometry

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,340
and you haven't seen the previous video

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,740
it might be a good idea to watch that

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,720
one first

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,300
this video became quite long so here's

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
an overview of the contents which allows

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
you to skip ahead if you don't want to

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,960
watch everything first I'll show how I

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,820
replace the original low resolution

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,219
camera of the zygote with a modern IP

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,160
camera to record high resolution

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
interferograms and then we'll take a

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,280
quick look at how we can use the camera

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
in combination with the software called

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,500
DFT Fringe to create detailed wavefront

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,760
maps

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,980
the interferometer came with a reference

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
transmission sphere but unfortunately

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
the waveform documentation of this item

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,460
was missing so to do meaningful

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,260
measurements with it we first need to

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,840
establish its accuracy by performing a

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,119
calibration and with that done we can

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,760
test some actual Optics we'll examine

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,860
the surface properties of a high quality

33
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,140
concave wafer scanner mirror from the

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,360
1970s then we'll take a look at the

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
wavefront quality of a vintage Canon F

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
1.2 lens from the early 1980s will do

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
the same for a modern full-frame Canon

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,799
EF zoom lens and in the last part of the

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,320
video I'll show you measurements on the

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,939
optical properties of a couple of

41
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,280
microscope objectives all in all there's

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,619
quite a lot to cover so let's Dive Right

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,360
In

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,460
as shown in the previous video the

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,079
interferometer is a somewhat basic

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,600
version that displayed low resolution

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,180
black and white images on a monitor for

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,979
visual evaluation the instrument

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,079
contained two cameras one for the

50
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,939
alignment of the Optics under test and

51
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,680
one for displaying the interferogram

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,380
both cameras had a rather limited

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,340
resolution of 320 times 240 pixels now

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,220
since this is not 1996 anymore we can

55
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,399
now do quite a bit better than that

56
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,259
for the new camera to record the

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,598
interferograms I wanted to use a housed

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,700
camera with some kind of Mount to be

59
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,560
able to attach various types of lenses

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
and if you look at the layout of the

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
instrument there's actually plenty of

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,560
space to place such a camera in the

63
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,959
instrument right here we just need to

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,879
redirect the light in the horizontal

65
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,520
Direction so what I did was remove the

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
old camera and the lens and then made a

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,900
bracket that can hold a first surface

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,180
mirror under 45 degrees and this mirror

69
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,580
redirects the vertical beam to a

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,080
horizontal one which can then be

71
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
captured by the camera I tried different

72
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,340
kinds of lenses and eventually settled

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,580
on this compact 25 millimeter C mount

74
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,099
lens that works for most situations it's

75
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,080
able to capture the full field of the

76
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,879
interferometer while at the same time

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,160
covering a fairly large area of the

78
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,260
camera chip but of course for specific

79
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,300
measurements it's possible to use other

80
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,700
lenses like lenses with a longer focal

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,280
length or a variable zoom lens and this

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,200
can be very useful if you want to take a

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,540
look at small details in interferograms

84
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,239
by the way I left the original alignment

85
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,920
camera where it was because it still

86
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,080
works fine and you actually don't need a

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,480
lot of resolution to do the alignment

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,879
so the original monitor is still used in

89
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,340
the setup but only during alignment

90
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,500
procedures

91
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,780
for powering the IP camera I connected

92
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,940
it to a 12 volt power supply already

93
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,980
present in the instrument and after that

94
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,540
there was just one more thing to do and

95
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,400
that was bringing the camera's UTP

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,379
connection to the housing of the

97
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,480
instrument and for this purpose I used a

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
two-sided UTP female connector one side

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,099
connects to the camera the other side

100
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,319
connects to a PC and with that the

101
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,200
conversion is complete

102
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,959
now I used an IDs ethernet camera for

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
the conversion but in fact any camera

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,739
will do as long as it can be accessed

105
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,019
from a computer and the images can be

106
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,599
stored to disk so to capture the data

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,879
what I do is I align the optic to be

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,680
measured such that a clear interferogram

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
is visible with well-defined fringes it

110
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,180
helps if the camera software has a

111
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,519
feature to monitor the maximum Fringe

112
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,739
intensity so that we can adjust it to

113
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,780
within the linear dynamic range of the

114
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,459
camera then I collect the number of

115
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,440
interferograms with somewhat different

116
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,839
Fringe angles and spacings and these can

117
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,478
then serve as the basis for a wavefront

118
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,340
analysis

119
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,560
for the actual wavefront calculations

120
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,199
we'll use a free software called DFT

121
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,320
Fringe it's programmed by Dale Eason who

122
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,479
took it upon himself to make advanced

123
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,060
interferometry accessible to the masses

124
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,520
it's designed with amateur telescoping

125
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,040
in mind but as will become clear its

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,900
application range is quite a bit broader

127
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,880
than that I won't delve into all the

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,860
functionality of the software instead

129
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,660
I'll just very quickly walk you through

130
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,060
the process of evaluating interferograms

131
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,759
and averaging wavefronts

132
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,800
so here is the start screen of DFT

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,500
Fringe and before you can evaluate the

134
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,419
inferiograms correctly a program

135
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,580
requires the input of a few settings

136
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,400
like what wavelength is used and what

137
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,320
The Fringe spacing in the interferogram

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,479
actually represents now in some

139
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,940
configurations each Fringe represents

140
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,400
one wavelength of phase shift but in

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,259
others like in Auto collimation this

142
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,380
value actually needs to be set to 0.5

143
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,820
and when all the parameters are set

144
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,300
we're basically ready to go

145
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,240
the software gets us to our results in a

146
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,000
few steps you start by importing a

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
recorded interferogram and Define the

148
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,759
areas you wish to include or exclude in

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,160
the wavefront evaluation

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
if that's done the software performs a

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,139
2d Fourier transform on the selected

152
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,479
area and allows us to do a bit of low

153
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,580
frequency spatial filtering this

154
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,620
filtering can for example remove low

155
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,900
spatial frequencies that are the result

156
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,720
of the global intensity variations due

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,759
to an even illumination over the full

158
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,280
surface and after setting the low

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
frequency spatial filtering the image is

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
resampled to a specific size and from

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,880
this the software calculates the

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,400
waveform data

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
when the software calculates the

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,600
wavefront it also fits the data to a

165
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,360
specific set of known aberrations this

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,160
feature allows for removing specific

167
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
aberrations from your analysis for

168
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
example tilt is generally not an

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,220
aberration of interest because it

170
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,319
describes the orientation between the

171
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,300
reference and the wavefront under test

172
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,460
and so it has nothing to do with the

173
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,100
shape of either surface now DFD Fringe

174
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,139
allows you to either include or exclude

175
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,300
it from your analysis

176
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,580
you can customize the presentation of

177
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,340
the results and the scale you can also

178
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,860
for example convert wavefront errors to

179
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,840
surface shape errors and choose to

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
represent them in nanometers instead of

181
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,759
waves all in all this is a very useful

182
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,100
tool for interferometric Fringe analysis

183
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,319
and on top of that it can be downloaded

184
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,800
for free

185
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,120
in all the upcoming experiments I will

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
use this F 0.75 transmission sphere as a

187
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,340
reference and as I mentioned in the

188
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,840
introduction we don't know anything

189
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,780
about its accuracy of shape so before we

190
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,699
can measure any meaningful results with

191
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,039
it we need to measure the accuracy of

192
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,500
the reference sphere first but how do we

193
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,900
do that we could of course calibrate the

194
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,880
surface of the transmission sphere by

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,860
comparing its shape to a more precise

196
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,620
reference surface but instead I want to

197
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,020
show you another method known as the

198
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,599
random Ball Method

199
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,699
the method requires the use of a small

200
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,039
smooth ball with a reflective surface

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
the surface of the ball doesn't need to

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,180
be perfectly spherical but I guess it

203
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,639
helps if it's quite close to spherical

204
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,380
now the only thing we need to do for the

205
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,060
experiment is to measure the surface

206
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,860
shape of the ball at many random

207
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,720
positions with the reference sphere and

208
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,060
then average these measurements now the

209
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,440
reason that this works is that if you

210
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,419
collect a lot of samples from a bowl

211
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,940
surface even if it's far from perfect

212
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,280
all the errors in the individual parts

213
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,199
of the surface will eventually average

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,020
out and the average will iterate to a

215
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,960
surface equivalent of a perfect sphere

216
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
and when you get to that point the only

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,340
error that remains is the surface error

218
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,500
in the reference sphere because it's

219
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,419
systematically present in all the

220
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,440
individual measurements

221
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
you can buy these special high accuracy

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,620
silicon carbide balls for this purpose

223
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,199
and these are pretty expensive however

224
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,900
there's a much cheaper way I just used a

225
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,639
Precision aluminum oxide bearing ball

226
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,800
that typically costs less than let's say

227
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,659
25 Euros online

228
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,458
the largest balls generally have a

229
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,679
diameter of around 10 millimeters and

230
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,299
have a variation in the diameter of

231
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,940
about one micron so they're not

232
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,159
incredibly precise but as you will see

233
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,500
precise enough for this experiment

234
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,660
to hold the ball I made a stand from

235
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,120
three quarter inch bearing balls glued

236
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,580
on top of an aluminum rod using epoxy

237
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,920
and now we have a calibration setup

238
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,519
ready for less than 30 Euros

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,500
calibration procedure itself involves

240
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
placing this ball at the center of the

241
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,279
radius of curvature of the transmission

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,339
sphere in some random orientation we

243
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,620
record an interferogram then choose a

244
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,779
different random area on the ball record

245
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,120
another one and so on

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,100
and here is what evaluating the results

247
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,680
looks like in Practice What You observe

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,779
is that in the individual measurements

249
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,640
the surface area is generally larger

250
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,740
than a quarter of lobda and it's

251
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,779
actually all over the place and this is

252
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,760
due to the errors present in the shape

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,459
of the ball but look what happens when

254
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,080
we start averaging these measurements

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,420
after 10 measurements the error has

256
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,220
basically dropped down to a tenth of a

257
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,620
lobda peaked Valley and by adding more

258
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
and more measurements to the average we

259
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,760
can gradually bring this down even

260
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,420
further until after evaluating about 50

261
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,880
interferograms we do not see Improvement

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,160
anymore in the result and at that point

263
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,380
we know that the error that remains is

264
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,540
basically the error in the transmission

265
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,880
sphere reference

266
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,040
if we look at the accuracy of shape in

267
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,200
the spherical reference it's about 1

268
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,080
20th of a wavelength peaked Valley and

269
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,459
we will consider this to be the

270
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,740
wavefront accuracy over the full area of

271
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,060
the transmission sphere

272
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,339
now in all the upcoming tests we will

273
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,440
only use a small fraction of this

274
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,180
reference surface which will make the

275
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
accuracy of the tests quite a bit higher

276
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,120
than 1 20th of a lot

277
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,760
DFD Fringe presents the value of the

278
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,580
strail ratio quite prominently and I

279
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,560
actually discussed sterile ratio in

280
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,860
another video I must admit still ratio

281
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,140
is not the most common parameter used in

282
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,480
the specification of the optical quality

283
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,180
of for example lenses but for specifying

284
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,339
wavefront performance close to the

285
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,140
diffraction limit I think it's a very

286
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,660
useful parameter what it describes is

287
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,820
basically just the ratio between where

288
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,800
wave energy actually ends up in the

289
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,019
image compared to where it should have

290
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,720
ended up if the optic were perfect

291
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,060
so here's a graph of an intensity

292
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
profile of an imperfect optic and of a

293
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,220
perfect optic now to calculate this

294
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,140
Trail we take the area that is under

295
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,320
both curves and name it B and then

296
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,540
divide this by the area under the

297
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,180
perfect curve so area a and this

298
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,579
represents the fraction of the light

299
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,800
energy that goes where it should have

300
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,740
gone in an image

301
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,620
since Trail ratio is a fraction its

302
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,200
value is between 0 and 1 and the value

303
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
of 1 only applies to an object that

304
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,700
performs at the theoretical limit now

305
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,380
roughly speaking an optic with a trail

306
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,680
ratio value above 0.83 is considered to

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
be diffraction Limited what this doesn't

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
mean is that the optic is performing

309
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
perfectly in this region it just means

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,579
that the dominant factor for reduced

311
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,040
sharpness is because of diffraction for

312
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,839
example because of a limited aperture

313
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,579
and to a lesser degrees due to

314
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,740
imperfections and things like a surface

315
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,279
shape so in a sense the value of 0.83 is

316
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,140
similar to stating that a quarter

317
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,760
overlapped up Peak to Value wavefront

318
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,100
error is diffraction limited because

319
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,200
both these values are kind of arbitrary

320
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,180
definitions of what is meant by

321
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,640
diffraction Limited

322
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,980
so our reference surface turns out to be

323
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,140
very accurate as we can conclude from

324
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,300
both this Trail value as well as from

325
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,579
the peak to Valley wavefront error but

326
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,440
of course that is kind of essential if

327
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,180
you want to use it to measure Optical

328
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,820
quality of other objects in the high end

329
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,660
of the range

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,500
the first thing we're going to measure

331
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
is the surface shape of this spherical

332
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,899
zero deer mirror it's about 250

333
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,880
millimeters in diameter and it has a

334
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,360
radius of curvature of 350 millimeters I

335
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,459
bought the mirror about 10 years ago on

336
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,399
eBay for around 100 euros the reflective

337
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,800
coating was in pretty bad shape so I

338
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,019
removed it but the remaining surface

339
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,060
reflectivity is four percent which is

340
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,940
ideal in this test setup the mirror

341
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,459
itself is from a 1970s broken Elmer

342
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,440
wafer scanner system and this was the

343
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,420
first commercial photolithographic

344
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,880
system that used non-contact exposure of

345
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,160
silicon Wafers so given its original

346
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,500
application you'd expect this mirror to

347
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
be quite accurate

348
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,420
the way we measure this mirror is with

349
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,579
the focus of the reference element in

350
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,500
the center of the radius of curvature of

351
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,899
the mirror so the tightly focused Light

352
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,240
Beam from the interferometer expands and

353
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
then reflects off the mirror surface and

354
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,440
then returns along approximately the

355
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
same path and is recombined with the

356
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,100
spherical reference wavefront that

357
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,560
reflects off the reference element and

358
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
any deviations from spherical in the

359
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,820
mirror surface will cause phase shifts

360
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,500
between the light reflecting of the

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,880
mirror surface and the spherical

362
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,980
reference and this can then be observed

363
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,079
as interference

364
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
here are a few typical interferograms

365
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,279
that were measured with this mirror

366
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,380
under a slight tilt and even though the

367
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,360
mirror is strongly curved you can

368
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,519
observe that in the measurements it only

369
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,740
covers about half the diameter of the

370
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,899
total measurement area available this

371
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,120
makes our accuracy of measurement much

372
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,540
higher than a 20th of a wavelength

373
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,220
so from the interferograms just

374
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,779
collected the waveform differences

375
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,639
between the mirror surface and that of

376
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,740
the reference element is calculated in

377
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,019
DFD Fringe and you can see that the peak

378
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,120
to Value accuracy of this mirror itself

379
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,300
is around one tenth of a wavelength now

380
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,639
in terms of surface shape accuracy this

381
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,620
means that the mirror never deviates

382
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,079
more than around 30 nanometers of that

383
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,300
of a perfect sphere

384
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,279
anyway being able to measure with this

385
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,959
level of precision is actually pretty

386
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,360
cool and it gave me confidence that the

387
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
instrument performs as expected

388
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,500
by the way if you've ever tried to make

389
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,839
a telescope Mirror by hand yourself you

390
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,060
might observe something familiar in the

391
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,820
wavefront plot The Mirror Has a slightly

392
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,220
turned down Edge although this one's

393
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,600
very small around 15 nanometers or so

394
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,459
next on the list of items to test is

395
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,480
this Canon FD 55 millimeter F 1.2 lens

396
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,300
this is a rather famous vintage lens in

397
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
the sense that it was actually the first

398
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,139
consumer lens containing an aspherical

399
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,160
element

400
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,459
with its F 1.2 aperture it's very light

401
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,620
sensitive and therefore well suited for

402
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,620
indoor photography without using a flash

403
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,300
the earliest versions of this lens

404
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,180
introduced in 1971 contained radioactive

405
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,459
thorium oxide but this one which was

406
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,980
bought by my father in March of 1980

407
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,620
does not contain thorium therefore it

408
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,660
also does not display the characteristic

409
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,639
radiation Browning observed in

410
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,399
radioactive lenses and on top of that it

411
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,500
has lift in the Box most of it's live so

412
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,560
it's a nearly pristine condition

413
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,660
for testing the waveform deformation in

414
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,579
this lens we utilize a configuration

415
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,680
called Auto collimation which is

416
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,079
schematically depicted here because the

417
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,699
light passes through the lens twice in

418
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,800
this test many aberrations are measured

419
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,779
to be twice as large as they would be

420
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,940
with a single pass so when this

421
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,459
configuration is used it requires us to

422
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,139
interpret The Fringe spacing as

423
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,660
equivalent to only 0.5 wavelength

424
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,720
instead of one wavelength

425
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,000
before I show you the results of the

426
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
measurement I should mention that doing

427
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,380
away front measurement on a lens is not

428
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,959
in any way representative for overall

429
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,839
lens performance basically we're testing

430
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,940
with only one particular wavelength of

431
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,579
light on the optical axis with the focus

432
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,860
setting to Infinity so factors like

433
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,959
chromatic aberrations of axis

434
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,120
performance in the image field and at

435
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,699
proximity are not included in this test

436
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,740
I've actually made a video on how to

437
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,899
quantitatively measure all these aspects

438
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,940
using another method and obtain a more

439
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,459
holistic performance but even with all

440
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,019
the limitations I think it's worthwhile

441
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,060
to take a look at the wavefront error

442
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,820
that this lens introduces

443
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,920
so here is the wavefront error of the

444
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,019
lens at its full aperture and as you can

445
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,720
see it's actually pretty large the total

446
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,820
peaked Valley wavefront error is more

447
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,920
than three lobda and the most apparent

448
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,440
errors are spherical aberration and some

449
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,180
astigmatism

450
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,220
the streel ratio is actually quite

451
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,780
disappointing as well

452
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,059
now as a consequence this lens can never

453
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,980
provide High sharpness images at the

454
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,599
maximum aperture

455
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,400
now it's interesting to see what happens

456
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,500
if we limit the aperture of this lens to

457
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,079
let's say F4 and by doing that we'll

458
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,900
lose a lot of light about 90 percent but

459
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,640
this also limits the wavefront error to

460
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,559
the one present in this central part

461
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,199
here so if we do the same wavefront

462
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,660
analysis at F4 suddenly the lens

463
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,940
performs the fraction limited because

464
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,299
reducing aperture to F4 eliminates

465
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,460
almost all of the spherical error and

466
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,500
astigmatism which is present in the

467
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,640
wavefront at full aperture

468
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,380
here's a comparison of the text on a

469
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,100
permanent marker shot with f 1.2 and f4

470
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,460
on an aps-c sensor it's clear that the

471
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,020
three laptop wavefront arrow is

472
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,120
influencing the sharpness and contrast

473
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
pretty badly so I guess the only way to

474
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,980
use this lens effectively is to always

475
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,380
set it to a smaller aperture whenever

476
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,480
there's sufficient light available

477
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,919
otherwise you'll end up with very soft

478
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,220
images

479
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,880
the Canon EF 24 to 105 millimeters full

480
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
frame zoom lens is next on our list I

481
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,440
just want to take a very brief look at

482
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,539
it mainly because I sometimes use it for

483
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,880
my YouTube videos with its maximum

484
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,520
aperture of f4 over the whole Zoom range

485
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,400
it's not particularly Photon hungry but

486
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,620
it always produces excellent image

487
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,240
sharpness which made me curious about

488
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,940
how small the wavefront errors in a high

489
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,580
quality lens actually are

490
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,280
it was measured in the same way as the F

491
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,220
1.2 lens so in outer collimation and

492
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,500
here are the wavefront errors at the

493
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,720
focal length settings of 24 millimeters

494
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,500
50 millimeters and 105 millimeters the

495
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,080
largest waveform errors are found at 105

496
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,820
millimeters focal distance where this

497
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,880
Trail ratio has dropped to 0.6 which by

498
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,280
the way is still a very decent value for

499
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,600
a lens

500
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,460
in the center of the range its

501
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,840
performance is basically diffraction

502
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,900
limited so concluding this lens performs

503
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,480
well in the full Zoom range that is of

504
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,880
course within all the limitations of the

505
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,780
current testing method

506
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,039
if you made it this far into the video

507
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,200
you're probably more than averagely

508
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,660
interested in Optics so for this last

509
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,640
part I thought I'd present measurements

510
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,400
that I did on microscope objectives all

511
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,080
objectives presented here are so called

512
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,299
Infinity corrected objectives and this

513
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,100
means that they are designed to work in

514
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,620
combination with a so-called tube lens

515
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,660
rather than create an image directly

516
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,179
like is the case with proximity

517
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,679
corrected objectives

518
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,960
since Infinity corrected objectives

519
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,600
basically project their image at

520
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,299
Infinity this allows us to correctly use

521
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,220
the outer collimation configuration for

522
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,080
testing

523
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,539
unlike camera lenses microscope

524
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,059
objectives aren't specified by focal

525
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,280
length and maximal focal distance to

526
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,500
aperture ratio instead they're

527
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,780
characterized by magnification and

528
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,120
numerical aperture and I'll very briefly

529
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,799
discuss these two aspects first

530
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,000
magnification describes the ratio

531
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,400
between the object size and the image

532
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,080
size that a particular microscope

533
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,660
objective is designed for you can of

534
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,039
course try to use it at a different

535
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,500
magnification by changing both the lens

536
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,299
object distance and the lens image

537
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,059
distance but if you do that it will not

538
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,160
perform optimally and this is important

539
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
because microscope Optics is required to

540
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,700
work close to the theoretical best

541
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,780
performance

542
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,760
so in this sense a microscope objective

543
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,320
is a bit different from a camera lens

544
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,299
which is basically designed to give you

545
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,059
acceptable image quality over a wide

546
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,539
range of object to lens distances

547
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,360
now specifying a high magnification is

548
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,460
only useful if the sharpness in the

549
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,380
image keeps up with the magnification

550
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,960
that is specified and that is why the

551
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,600
magnification and numerical aperture of

552
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,299
objectives are related because numerical

553
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,640
aperture is a key parameter for

554
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,059
resolving small features

555
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
by definition the numerical aperture is

556
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,860
equal to the refractive index of the

557
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,320
medium that contains the object times

558
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,380
the sine of the maximum angle Theta at

559
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,179
which light originating from the object

560
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,340
can be captured this means that

561
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,860
numerical aperture increases with the

562
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,020
refractive index of the medium and with

563
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,179
the value of theta

564
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,980
now since all the objectives I will

565
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,960
discuss today are intended for using air

566
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,900
and not in water or oil we can simplify

567
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,820
things because the refractive index of

568
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,039
air is around one

569
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,780
so for now we can just ignore the

570
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,640
refractive index which means that the

571
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
numerical aperture in all cases

572
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,840
discussed here is just equal to the sine

573
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,700
of theta

574
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,919
the exact reason why numerical aperture

575
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,659
is the key parameter for achieving a

576
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,179
high sharpness is quite fascinating but

577
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,980
it's kind of a rabbit hole which I don't

578
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,539
want to dive in now

579
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,539
today I will just show you the formula

580
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,640
so the size of the smallest features

581
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,740
that can theoretically be resolved by a

582
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,720
microscope objective are proportional to

583
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,500
a constant times the wavelength of light

584
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,419
divided by the numerical aperture and

585
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,400
this means that it's possible to resolve

586
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,440
smaller features by either using a

587
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,780
shorter wavelength of light or use a

588
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,120
higher numerical aperture

589
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,159
this relationship explains why

590
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,740
magnification and numerical aperture are

591
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,080
so closely related in the specification

592
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,940
of microscope objectives because

593
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,980
attempting to pair a high magnification

594
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,380
with a low numerical aperture is pretty

595
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,480
useless it will just result in a

596
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,080
magnified image of pore sharpness

597
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,240
let's have a look at the measurements on

598
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,700
this Nikon 10 times objective with a

599
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,700
numerical aperture of 0.3 here is an

600
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,620
image of the wavefront error of this

601
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,780
objective and it shows us that the

602
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,299
errors are in fact very small the

603
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,280
wavefront is accurate within seven

604
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,080
hundredths of a wavelength for the

605
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,900
entire aperture and this Trail is 0.99

606
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,480
which is looking great so the major

607
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,400
contribution of the surface area is

608
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,020
actually a very slight spherical

609
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,080
aberration but all in all it's really a

610
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,600
top quality piece

611
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
now let's examine a different objective

612
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
like this 20 times Leica flu or tar with

613
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,400
a numerical aperture of 0.5 and do the

614
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,260
same waveform measurement

615
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,600
interestingly the spherical aberration

616
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,640
in this objective is noticeably more

617
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,059
pronounced both the peaked Valley Arrow

618
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,580
as well as a strail ratio is only just

619
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,380
on the good side of the diffraction

620
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,020
limit now it might be tempting to

621
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,760
conclude that this objective is not as

622
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,500
good as the previous one but that's

623
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
actually not the case the reason behind

624
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,940
the spherical aberration is in this

625
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,039
particular number that can be found on

626
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,679
the objective the number represents the

627
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,299
optimum coverslip thickness in

628
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,299
millimeters for this objective

629
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,640
so what the manufacturer assumes is that

630
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,440
you're going to use a glass coverslip

631
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,900
when you use your microscope and it has

632
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,820
therefore already compensated the

633
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,460
optical properties for a specific glass

634
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,600
thickness

635
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
now you might think huh 0.70 millimeters

636
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,179
of glass thickness how is that ever

637
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,880
going to influence the focus and indeed

638
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,400
with low numerical aperture Optics there

639
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,860
will generally not be a problem however

640
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,260
with increasing numerical aperture even

641
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,020
a gloss plate this thin can introduce a

642
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,419
significant spherical abrasion this is

643
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,400
Illustrated in this Ray tracing figure

644
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,179
for a numerical aperture of 0.7 in a

645
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,640
perfect optic all rays will end in a

646
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,220
single point but add a cover gloss and

647
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,320
certainly the area where the Rays end up

648
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,500
has significant size

649
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,179
now of course the previous waveform

650
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,980
measurement was done without a cover

651
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,799
slip so the question is what happens if

652
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,679
we add a cover slip in the light path I

653
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,539
quickly try this with a gloss thickness

654
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,419
of 0.60 millimeters so quite close to

655
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,760
the optimum value and it resulted in

656
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,559
this measurement it reduced the

657
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,900
spherical aberration quite a bit and so

658
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,940
this is something to realize when you

659
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,980
use a high numerical aperture objective

660
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,860
that it can only perform at its Peak

661
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,600
Performance when used in combination

662
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,440
with the cover slip thickness specified

663
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
so a few years ago I bought this

664
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,140
unmarked Nikon 20 times blonde Apple OEM

665
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,140
objective for use in my maskless wafer

666
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,360
stepper these Nikon objectives can be

667
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,700
purchased on eBay for around a hundred

668
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,400
dollars a piece and are widely available

669
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,380
it was in perfect shape when it got here

670
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,659
but when I started using it something

671
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,419
was a bit off depending on how I use it

672
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,620
exactly

673
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,419
now when I published the video on the

674
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,460
Master's waiver stepper people at the

675
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,520
Forum called photo

676
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,260
macrography.net made me aware of the

677
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,000
fact that these particular types of

678
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,100
objectives aren't optically the same as

679
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,320
the corresponding standard Nikon

680
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,179
microscope objectives they're actually

681
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,000
modified versions that are designed for

682
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,039
a different cover slip thickness

683
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,020
the forms that on this subject mentioned

684
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,760
that these perform better when used in

685
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,440
combination with two or three cover

686
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,600
slips and since I now have an

687
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,820
interferometer available let's see if we

688
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,740
can narrow this value down a bit further

689
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,760
here is the spherical aberration of the

690
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,919
objective without a cover slip the

691
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,559
wavefront error is one lobda so without

692
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,600
a correction it will certainly perform

693
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,039
very poorly

694
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,020
and here I summarize the individual

695
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,960
wavefront measurements for zero

696
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,419
one two

697
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,720
three and four cover slips

698
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,460
I think the effect of adding more glass

699
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,779
is pretty clear

700
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,700
now you can see that the wavefront error

701
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,039
sort of flips over between two and three

702
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,220
coverslips of glass thickness

703
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,440
now what we can do is take for example

704
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,600
the peak to Value spherical abrasion

705
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,220
from these measurements and plot the

706
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,720
values as a function of the glass

707
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,000
thickness in a graph and by fitting a

708
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,820
line through these data we find that a

709
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,940
minimum aberration is found at around

710
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,520
0.42 or 0.43 millimeters and this

711
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,620
thickness is right between two and three

712
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,539
copper slips like was stated on the

713
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,580
Forum here is a similar graph that I

714
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,100
made for the maximum still ratio which

715
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,620
actually yields exactly the same outcome

716
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,460
so if we were to add 0.42 millimeters of

717
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,679
glass sheet when using it we can

718
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,059
effectively get rid of the huge

719
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,100
spherical aberration completely and use

720
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,720
this objective at its maximum

721
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,480
performance level again

722
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,059
okay we finally come to the end of the

723
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,400
video I hope I gave you some ideas of

724
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,080
how interferometry can be used for

725
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
optical testing anyway thanks for

726
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,760
