hey everyone today I want to talk about

Optical interferometry a method that is

frequently used to measure the

properties of optical components and

systems

what initially made me want to do a

video about this subject is this zygo

interferometer that I bought a while ago

secondhand

a new instrument of this type is

financially far out of my reach and I

must admit that this one wasn't a

bargain either but the thing is I wanted

to own a high quality interferometer for

a long time if only to get away from the

do-it-yourself setups that I've used so

far and since these instruments are not

abundantly available secondhand I just

had to take this rare opportunity to buy

one

in case you have no idea what this

instrument is with it you can very

accurately measure the shape of flat and

spherical Optical interfaces like the

ones you find on lenses and mirrors and

with accurately I mean in the nanometer

range

but not only that you can also measure

the performance of complete Optical

systems so a good interferometer is an

indispensable tool for anyone involved

in Optical fabrication because in the

end the quality of your Optics is mainly

limited by the quality of your testing

methods

this particular instrument was produced

by zygo in August of 1996 it was sold to

Philips Electronics in Eindhoven where

it was used to check the surface shape

of lenses of special Optical disk drives

from what I understood some of these

lenses were produced from small polished

glass balls and these were cut in pieces

and then transformed into very short

focal distance lenses now at some point

the activity was transferred to a

Phillips spin-off called anterion and

the interferometer was sold to an

employee who basically stored it for a

couple of years he then sold it to me

together with a black and white Monitor

and the transmission sphere that was

used to test the lenses

in this video I'll first discuss the

principle behind interferometry and then

we'll take a look at the layout of the

instrument and how it works exactly and

in an upcoming video I'll show you how I

pimped the instrument a bit with a

modern CCD camera

as I said earlier in Optics manufacturer

interferometry is a frequently used

method to characterize both Optical

surfaces as well as complete systems and

the method is based on analyzing

interference patterns and extract

so-called wavefront information from

them and I will discuss the meaning of

the word wavefront in a second

interferometry is an extremely sensitive

and accurate method that can be used to

establish the general shape of an

interface but also things like waviness

or even surface roughness it does also

have some limitations the measurement

ranges generally fairly limited to

several microns also it's unsuitable for

interfaces that contain sharp step-like

height features because these cannot be

unambiguously identified and so in

general interferometry is most accurate

when the surfaces we want to test are

fairly smooth

now I just mentioned the word wavefront

which I think is not a trivial concept I

guess we've all experienced wavefronts

at some points in our lives but I'm not

referring to those in Optics away from

this actually a continuous set of points

that have identical phase so what does

that mean well from a classical

Viewpoint light is an electromagnetic

wave that harmonically oscillates and

propagates in space and at any given

point in this process the electric and

magnetic field components can be

described by the Maxwell equations so

here I've tried to schematically draw

the electromagnetic field in a somewhat

larger volume and if you examine the

phase of these waves you can identify

planes where the face of the

electromagnetic field is identical and

the continuous set of points that have

the same phase value is called away

front

one property of a wavefront is that its

shape is always transverse or

perpendicular to the local direction of

wave propagation here this is

Illustrated for a few differently shaped

wavefronts where the arrows indicate the

direction of wave propagation now in

general phase relationships for

different points in space are only well

defined when the waves have one specific

wavelength and if we want to do

interferometry it's vital that the light

we use is of one particular wavelength

which is also called monochromatic light

and in the rest of this video I'll

assume that the light used is more or

less monochromatic

a frequently used way to generate

monochromatic radiation is by means of a

laser and this is because the process of

stimulated emission which takes place in

the laser cavity favors the generation

of light in a very narrow wavelength

range also the wavefront exiting the

laser cavity is virtually flat over the

aperture and because the light has an

extremely well defined wavelength in

other words it has a very narrow

spectral bandwidth phase relationships

in the field exiting the laser can be

preserved over long distances

another way to say this is that lasers

have a long coherence length which is

generally between half a meter up to

several kilometers for certain special

types of lasers

in practice this means that if we take

two points A and B in the light path and

we look at the variations in the phase

difference between the two points we

will find that these will be relatively

small and the distance over which

variations in Phase remain acceptable is

called the coherence length as you can

see from this equation the coherence

length LC is inversely proportional to

the spectral bandwidth Delta Nu of the

light source and so light sources with a

very narrow emission line will generally

have a long coherence length

another source of monochromatic light

frequently used in interferometry is the

low pressure sodium lamp which mainly

generates light in a narrow emission

band at 589 nanometers however the

spectral bandwidth of the sodium

emission line is much broader than that

of lasers and the phase relationships

generally only hold over distances

smaller than a millimeter

now measuring the shape of a waveform

directly in the visible part of the

electromagnetic spectrum is not easy and

that is because of the high frequencies

involved for electromagnetic radiation

of longer wavelengths like for example

radio waves we can measure the phase of

the alternating Fields directly and that

is because the oscillations have

relatively low frequency say generally

somewhere in the mega or gigahertz range

and so we can point a bunch of antennas

to the sky measure the electromagnetic

signals that are received in each of

them and then establish the shape of the

wavefront for a particular frequency by

looking for phase correlations and based

on this information we can identify the

exact direction from which the radiation

is emitted

but the visible light has a frequency

more than a thousand times higher than

even the highest frequency radio waves

and for frequencies this high it's

technically infeasible to measure phase

directly for an oscillating

electromagnetic field

however what we can easily measure with

Optical detectors like CCD or CMOS

sensors is spatial intensity variations

and that is where interferometry comes

in instead of trying to measure the

phase in light directly this method

works by studying the interference

patterns resulting from the addition of

a second wavefront that has a known

shape

let me start by showing you a very

simple example of how this works in

light

for this experiment we need a

monochromatic light source and a flat

surface as a light source we'll use a

sodium lamp and for the surface we'll

use a flat Optical test glass

now a typical air gloss interface

reflects about four percent of the

incident light and with a uniform light

source we observe a uniform reflection

let's now place two differently shaped

surfaces on top of this reference

surface for evaluation and what we now

observe is that these objects show two

different interference patterns the part

of the left shows straight lines with

equal spacing and I wanted to write this

place these curved lines or circular

fringes depending on the exact surface

orientation now it's these intensity

variations that actually contain

detailed information about the

difference in shape between the

reference surface and the two surfaces

under tests and we just need to know how

to interpret what we see exactly

so what do we see well let me explain

with an animation I admit the following

is a simplification and it's not

correctly visualizing the physics but

it's actually quite illustrative here is

away from that has just reflected off a

flat reference surface so this wavefront

is basically also flat and so the image

shows a 2d cross-section of the flat

Optical wavefront

now we place a sensor in the path of the

light we can measure the intensity and

what we observe is that it's basically

the same everywhere and this tells us

exactly nothing about the shape of the

wavefront

now let's add a second wavefront that

has reflected of a second surface that

is slightly tilted in this example the

wavefront is also flat and what we

observe is that the intensity now

becomes non-uniform and this is caused

by constructive and destructive

interference between the two reflected

wavefronts at the second interface here

the electromagnetic field is the linear

sum of the contributions of the fields

of the two wavefronts and so in some

points where these contributions are

always in Phase they add up on the other

hand in places where the two are exactly

out of phase the field contributions

cancel each other out and if they are of

equal amplitude effectively the

resulting field becomes zero

in the case of two flat wavefronts we

will observe linear and equally spaced

fringes and the density of the

interference pattern itself is dependent

on the wedge or angle between the two

surfaces and the position of the fringes

is dependent on the distance between the

two surfaces now you might think that

linear and equally spaced fringes are

indicative for the presence of two flat

surfaces and that's partly correct but

two curved wavefronts with exactly the

same radius of curvature will actually

also display linear and equally spaced

fringes when displays are tilted

however when two waveforms have

different radii this results in curve

fringes and this is for example the case

when we have a flat and a spherical

wavefront interfering or when we have

two spherical waveforms that have a

different radius of curvature so I guess

it's important to realize that the

observed interference pattern only gives

us information about differences in

wavefront shape

the example just shown with the Sodium

lamp we only observe interference

between the interfaces when they're

placed very close together and that is

because of the limited coherence length

of the light so whether we can see a

clear interference pattern is dependent

on whether stable phase relationships

exists between the reflections coming

off the two surfaces at the point where

they start interfering and this means

that with a coherence length smaller

than a millimeter the surfaces need to

be quite close to each other in order to

observe interference fringes

now I just stated that in constructive

interference the electromagnetic fields

add up and in destructive interference

the two contributions cancel each other

out so what does this mean for intensity

well light intensity is equivalent to

the power per unit of surface and so

it's actually not the same thing as the

magnitude of the electronic field in

fact intensity scales with the square of

this field and so if we have two

reflections of equal magnitude say both

are four percent this means that for the

location of constructive interference

the intensity could be four times as

high and that is actually what is

generally observed in interference

patterns that the intensity in the

bright areas is much brighter than the

sum of the two individual intensities

but of course if we look on average the

intensity over the whole area will still

be equal to the sum of the two

individual intensities

anyway enough background let's return to

the zygote interferometer itself and

take a peek under the hood to see what's

going on inside

in order to do that we need to remove

two different Lids the outer one is made

of plastic and it's basically just

cosmetic and the second one is made out

of aluminum sheet metal and it is

intended as RF shielding for the

electronics inside

the first thing you notice is that it

isn't awfully full inside there is a

helium neon laser with its high voltage

power supply then there are a few

Optical components like a steering

mirror for a laser beam a variable

filter that can be moved mechanically

using a rod and this Rod also operates a

switch that activates either of two PCB

cameras that can also be found in this

top part of the interferometer

and the cameras by the way have CCD

chips of about four by six millimeter in

size and are fairly low resolution

now both cameras have lenses mounted in

front of them and one of the cameras is

above a tiny beam splitter and the other

one is above a diffuser with a Crosshair

printed on it

in the bottom compartment behind the lid

here we find the mains 12 volt DC power

supply a large beam splitter a mirror

under 45 degrees and a four inch

collimation lens and apart from a few

brackets and mounts that hold the Optics

together that is basically it

so you might wonder why was this thing

the price of a luxury car back in 1996

well apart from I suspect a healthy

profit margin there are several reasons

of course it's not really a mass

manufactured item but another reason is

that every component inside appears to

be of very high quality take for example

the helium neon laser according to the

label the tube has been specifically

selected for this type of instrument why

well if we look at the specification of

the coherence length of the

interferometer we see that it's larger

than 100 meters this means that the

wavelength variations in the laser light

need to be extremely low so that the

phase relationships hold over distances

of more than 100 meters now I calculated

what this means in terms of frequency

stability and found that variations in

the frequency of the light cannot be

more than 2 times 10 to the minus seven

percent and so this means that not just

any random laser will do

so let me take you through the

functionality of all the optical

components step by step using schematics

here is the helium mule laser which

outputs a highly coherent beam of light

and the direction of the beam can be

optimized with this small steering

mirror after which the beam goes through

a variable attenuation filter now this

filter allows for adjustment of the

general brightness of the laser beam and

after having passed the attenuation

filter the beam is going into a gradient

index lens which is connected to a very

small beam splitter

now a gradient index lens is a small

glass rod that contains a gradient in

refractive index that runs from the

center to the edge of the rod and since

the refractive index has the highest

value in the center the optical

wavefront in the laser beam is gradually

delayed more towards the center of the

rod and the waveform therefore becomes

curved which effectively results in

focusing of the light into a tight focal

point and after passing this focal point

the beam expands again into a nicely

spherical wavefront

a small beam splitter sends the

spherical waveform into the partially

reflective surface of a second much

larger beam splitter and this surface

reflects the light towards a collimation

lens where the light exits the

instrument

the function of the collimation lens is

to convert the spherical wavefront into

a flat wavefront of four inches in

diameter and this flat waveform can

serve as the basis for all kinds of

interferometric tests for example we can

place two partially reflective flat

interfaces into this output beam one

being the reference interface and one

being the interface that we'd like to

test for flatness and due to the large

coherence length of the light more than

100 meters these interfaces don't have

to be necessarily very close together

the light reflecting of these surfaces

is directed back into the interferometer

approximately along the same path as it

came from goes through a small beam

splitter again and then is collimated

and projected on the CCD chip and this

allows us to observe the interference

pattern between the two Reflections and

evaluate this visually on the monitor

now to steer the light off both the

reference and test surface exactly back

through the tiny beam splitter here is

pretty hard and you don't see anything

with camera one until things are almost

perfectly aligned so to make life a lot

easier the people at zygo edit this

alignment functionality to the system

part of the light from the reflections

can pass this larger beam splitter and

this part continues straight on it's

reflected at 90 degrees angle and then

reaches the glass diffuser plate that

contains a Crosshair pattern

because this diffuser plate is exactly

at the focal distance of the collimation

lens the reflections create tiny spots

here and their positions can be observed

by camera 2 that is only intended for

alignment purposes now this alignment

unit has a much larger field of view and

what we can do now is simply align the

position of the surface reflection such

that they are at the center of the

Crosshair and when that's the case the

system is also automatically aligned on

camera one we can immediately observe an

interferogram

now the interferometers that I made

myself did not have this kind of feature

and I must admit that this really makes

aligning Optics a piece of cake

here you see the location of the

collimation lens viewed from the outside

of the instrument in front of it is an

adjustment mechanism that is intended

for mounting various reference surfaces

to the interferometer directly like for

example the f.7 D5 transmission sphere

that came with interferometer

the adjustment mechanism has two degrees

of freedom which are tip and tilt and

this allows the angle of the

transmission reference to be oriented

with respect to the surface under test

so when testing Optical components you

generally test the surface shape before

the interfaces get coated and so in the

case of glosses means that they reflect

around four percent of the incident

light

so the transmission reference also needs

to reflect around four percent back into

the interferometer to get high contrast

fringes

not to test spherical surfaces you need

a spherical reference surface that

somehow reflects four percent of the

light exiting the infrometer right back

into the instrument

here I've drawn a schematic of the

inside of a transmission sphere assembly

to show you how that is achieved

the reference surface is the last

interface of the assembly here indicated

in yellow and all the other surfaces are

anti-reflection coated for the laser

wavelength

but even more importantly they're also

designed in such a way that the Light

reaches the reference interface exactly

perpendicular and this means that it's

the only interface in the transmission

sphere that sends a reflection back

where it came from and then enters the

interferometer as a collimated beam and

of course

96 of the light continues onto the

surface under test which also reflects

around four percent and so we observe

the interference occurring between these

two interfaces

with a spherical transmission reference

we can test convex as well as concave

optics for convex Optics only radii is

smaller than the radius of the

transmission sphere itself can be tested

and for concave Optics the only

limitation for the radius to be tested

is that it should be less than half of

the maximum coherence length of the

light source that we use which is in

this case 50 meters

now I want to save most of the

experiments that I had in mind for

another video but let's just do one

simple experiment for this test we'll

just use the flat wavefront exiting the

instrument and what we'll try to measure

is the difference in shape between the

two surfaces of a zero to your test

Clause this test class has one side

which I know is very flat around 120th

of a wavelength and this is going to be

our reference interface but the other

side is somewhat less flat and what

we'll try to find out is how much that

is

the two interfaces are spaced 20

millimeters apart and both reflect

around four percent of the incident

light so we can just place the disc in

the beam exiting the interferometer

align the position of the two

Reflections simultaneously and then look

at the interference pattern and this is

what it looks like as you can see we get

a nice and clear interference pattern

which by the way is extremely stable

with no effects of vibrations from the

environment and that is because the two

surfaces are basically mechanically

connected to each other by a solid piece

of zero Doer

now the small circular spots are just

dust particles in the optical path and

these are not important for our

evaluation

all the information about the different

in shape and orientation between the two

surfaces is contained in the four more

or less vertical fringes and because we

know that one side is almost perfectly

flat any curvature in The Fringe pattern

is a result of non-flatness of the

second interface

so let's try to evaluate this pattern

visually the most obvious feature is of

course the presence of the four vertical

fringes that indicate that there is a

wedge between the two interfaces in the

horizontal Direction and we can evaluate

how large this wedge is based on the

number of fringes it's a little over

four lobda wavefront meaning that there

is a wedge half of that between the two

surfaces so just two wavelengths y half

well that is because in reflection any

deviations in surface shape lead to

twice the deviation in the wave front

shape and so deviations in the surface

shape are only half of that observed in

the wavefront

now since the wavelength of the laser is

633 nanometers and the wedge is two

lobbed up between the two surfaces this

would mean a gradient in distance of

approximately 1.3 microns but there is a

little catch in this case because we are

comparing two surfaces with zero during

between them we should actually use the

wavelength in this material which means

that we should divide the wavelength in

air or vacuum by the refractive index of

zero deer which is 1.54

so this means that the wedge is actually

only 840 nanometers but which side is

thicker it's actually quite hard to tell

as for which we would see the same type

of interference pattern in either case

so at this point we just don't know

okay let's for a moment focus on the

curvature of the fringes now which

indicates a difference in the radius

between the two surfaces and if we look

at how much the curvature in the fringes

deviates from straight lines we see that

it's largest here in the center it's

about 0.4 times The Fringe spacing which

translates to 0.4 wavelengths of height

difference between the edge and the

center of the disc

for the surface error which again is

half of that we find 0.2 wavelengths now

since we also need to use the wavelength

inside zero do here this means that the

surface curvature is 0.2 times the

wavelength divided by the refractive

index which results in a value of 82

nanometers

but in which direction is the curve is

the surface under test 82 nanometers

concave or convex as for the direction

of the wedge there is no easy way to

tell so now we end up with these four

configurations of which only one can be

correct

with a little logic though you could at

this point already discard two of these

as infeasible but of course you want to

know exactly which configuration of the

four is correct right

so if that's indeed the case figure it

out yourself you just need two more

pieces of information here is a first

hint if I press my finger against the

back side of the disk so the service and

the test we can observe that the

interferogram changes due to the

temperature increase of the material by

the heat of my finger locally it's only

a few degrees Celsius higher but the

effect is very noticeable because we are

measuring in the nanometer range

now the second piece of information you

need is about the expansion coefficient

of the material as you can see from the

specifications of zero zero it can be

either positive or negative

but this piece of 02 has a positive

coefficient of thermal expansion which

means it expands with temperature

increase and with these two additional

pieces of information it's possible to

tell which of these four options is

correct now the first person to make a

comment with the correct answer and of

course why owns the pinned comment

okay so the letter was a very brief

explanation of how you can evaluate

interferograms visually and the above

example was actually relatively easy

imagine your interferogram looks

something like this or this in these

cases it would be quite a bit more

challenging to make accurate statements

about the exact surface shape

and this is why in the next video about

the subject I have replaced the current

analog camera with a high resolution IP

camera and this allows for a very

detailed evaluation of the

interferograms using software

with the help of this software we can

measure wedges angles surface curvature

and even the effect of warm fingers very

accurately also we'll take a look at how

to measure the shape of various Optical

surfaces and the quality of lens

assemblies so hopefully I'll see you in

the next video again
